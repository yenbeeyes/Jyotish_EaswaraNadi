Libra-01,உதையத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் நீச்சனாய் பாக்கிய விரையாதிபனுடன் கூடி ஸ்வக்ஷேத்திர திருதிய ரோகாதிபதியால் பிதுர் ஸ்தானத்தை நோக்கப் பட்டிருந்தால் தந்தை வர்க்கம் மூன்றிலிரண்டு விர்த்தி. ஜேஷ்டனுக்குத் தாரமிரண்டு. ஜேஷ்டனால் பொருளழிவுண்டென்பர்.,"Sun is in Libra Lagna debilitated and is conjoined with Mercury, the 9th and 12th lord, and Jupiter, the lord of the 3rd and 6th house, is placed in his own house in Sagittarius and aspects the 9th house of father, out of 3 lineage of father, two will flourish. The elder sibling will have two wives, and there will be a loss of finances because of the elder brother. Explanation: Father’s siblings Father had three siblings, of whom two will flourish- Jupiter is in the 3rd house from the Sun, the father. Jupiter aspects the 11th house from the Sun, confirming the presence of an elder sibling. The 11th house from the Sun is also the 3rd house of siblings from the 9th house of the father, which might have given one more sibling, making a total of three siblings. Jupiter is well placed in the 3rd house from the Sun, and it also aspects the 11th house from the Sun, which also happens to be the 3rd house from the 9th house of the father. Jupiter aspects the 11th house from the 9th house of the father.  All the houses representing the siblings are aspected by the powerful Jupiter. But the 11th house from the 9th house is also aspected by the Sun and Mercury, and Mercury is lord of the 6th house from Aries and 12th lord from the Sun, bringing loss because of the elder sibling. The other two will perish because of the only aspect of powerful Jupiter. In Nadi astrology, Jupiter in a Kendra or Trikona to the Sun (especially in its own house) signifies continuity of the father’s lineage. Hence, “two out of three will flourish.” Why only two survive despite Jupiter’s strength? • Jupiter alone would ensure all three survive, but the presence of the debilitated Sun and Mercury (6th and 12th lord from Aries, which is the 9th house of the father) creates Maraka and Vyaya influences. This explains why only two survive and one perishes. The elder sibling will have two wives-11th house from the Sun, as well as from the 9th house of the father represents the elder sibling. Lord of the 11th house from the Sun is the Sun himself. The 11th house from the 9th house is Aries, and no planets are there. No mention of the Lord of Aries either. But the 7th house representing the wife of the elder brother from Aries has two planets. Hence elder sibling has two wives. If the 7th house from the sibling’s Lagna (Aries here) is occupied or aspected by multiple planets, particularly natural benefics and malefics together, or there’s Rahu-Ketu influence, the elder sibling will have multiple marriages. Additional Point: From Aries (elder sibling’s Lagna), Mercury also becomes the 3rd and 6th lord, showing issues related to communication, disputes, and financial transactions. This strengthens the possibility that the elder sibling’s financial decisions or actions bring loss to the younger sibling. Also, Mercury being conjunct the debilitated Sun amplifies miscalculations and poor financial decisions, possibly leading to debt or loss.",Libra,Surya
Libra-02,"உதயத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் கர்மாதிபதியுடன் கூடி சகோதர ஸ்தானமேறிய லக்கின அஷ்டமாதியால் பாக்கியத்தை நோக்கப் பட்டிருந்தால், பிதா சொல் பிரட்டுள்ளவனாய் ஜீவனம் செய்வான். தந்தைக்கு ஐந்தாறு வைப்பாட்டிகளுண்டாம். ஜாதகனுக்கு இருபதில் பிதுர் மரணமாவனென்பர்.","In Libra Lagna Pitrukaraka Sun is placed along with the Moon, and in the 3rd house of sibling Lagna, and 8th lord Venus is placed and aspects the 9th house of Bhagya, the father will lead a life without adhering to or keeping his words. The father will have five or six concubines or mistresses. When the native is 20 years old father will die. Explanation: 1. Father’s Character – “Will not keep his word” (சொல் பிரட்டுள்ளவன்): • Sun is the Pitrukaraka and is placed with Moon in the Lagna (Libra). • Libra Lagna is a Venusian and airy sign, inclined toward relationships and material pleasures rather than firm principles. • The Moon is a chanchala graha (wavering planet), representing instability of mind and emotions. When conjunct with the Sun in Lagna, this affects the father’s character directly, making him unreliable or unable to keep promises. • From the father’s standpoint (9th house), the Sun-Moon conjunction falls in the 1st house from the 9th house (Sagittarius). This directly affects his personality traits. Nadi Principle: • If the Sun (Pitrukaraka) is afflicted by the Moon or Rahu and placed in an airy or Venusian sign (Libra), it often leads to moral instability and loose character. 2. Father Will Have Five or Six Concubines (Mistresses): • This result is quite specific and typical of Nadi predictions, which often reveal such intimate aspects of life. • From the Lagna (Libra), the 3rd house (Sagittarius) has Venus, the 8th lord. • Venus, a natural karaka for relationships and sensual pleasures, placed in the 3rd house (communication, desires, and Kama Trikona) and also being the 8th lord (house of hidden affairs), directly contributes to this prediction. • Venus aspects the 9th house (Bhagya – Father), clearly indicating indulgence in such relationships. Nadi Principle Applied: • When Venus (karaka for pleasures) is associated with the 8th house or its lord and influences the 9th house, it directly indicates hidden pleasures and multiple illicit relationships. • The number “five or six” may come from deeper Nadi secrets or be based on the degree placement and nakshatra pada influence, which isn’t explicitly mentioned here. 3. Father’s Death at the Age of 20 (for the Native): • From the native’s Lagna (Libra), the Sun (father) is afflicted by the Moon. • Venus, as the 8th lord, occupies the 3rd house (Maraka Sthana from the 9th house of father) and aspects the 9th house. This is a strong Maraka Yoga for the father. • 20 years of age typically corresponds to the native running either the Venus Dasa or its Antardasa, depending on the Dasa system followed (if we assume Venus Mahadasha based on the native’s Moon placement). • Also, the 20th year is critical as it activates the 9th house of the father in the Chara Dasha or Nadi Amsa systems, which could lead to events related to the father. Nadi Principle on the Timing of Father’s Death: • The combination of Lagna lord’s placement (Venus) in the 3rd house (Maraka from 9th) and its aspect on the 9th house activates fatal events for the father during the years connected to Venus or 9th house significations. • Exact timing is a specialty of Nadi astrology, often calculated based on the Band of Years concept (Chakra Paddhati) or specific nakshatra-based age bands. Conclusion: • All results mentioned in the verse can be explained by Traditional and Nadi logic. • The number “five or six” mistresses is specific and may not be derived purely from planetary logic—it likely stems from Nadi Siddha Secrets or Nakshatra Pada-based calculations. • The timing of death at age 20 is a classical Nadi timing prediction based on combined dasa activation and planetary influences on the 9th house.",Libra,Surya
Libra-03,"உதையத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் நீச்சமடைந்து கேதுவுடன் கூடி சப்தம கேந்திரம் பெற்ற கர்மாதிபனால் பார்க்கப்பட்டால் தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆணிரண்டு, பெண்ணிரண்டு, ஒருவன் தேசாந்திரம். தந்தை, ஜாதகனுக்கு ஆறு வயதில் அரிட்டமாவனென்பர்.","In Libra Lagna, Pitrukaraka Sun is debilitated and is with Ketu and is aspected by the 10th house karma Lord Moon placed in the 7th kendra. In the father’s lineage, there will be two male and two female members. One will get exiled. When the native is six years old father will pass away. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage – Two Male and Two Female Members: • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is debilitated in Libra and conjoined with Ketu, indicating a karmic disturbance and separation energy related to the father’s lineage. • Moon, the 10th lord (Karma), is placed in the 7th house (Aries) and aspects the Lagna where Sun and Ketu are placed. • The 7th house is a powerful Kendra and represents relationships and external influences. • From the 9th house (father's house), the 3rd house (siblings of the father) falls in Aquarius, whose lord, Saturn, is not mentioned in the verse, but since no benefic aspects are mentioned, it indicates a limited number of siblings. Why specifically 2 males and 2 females? • In Nadi Astrology, Ketu with the Sun symbolizes severance and limited continuation of lineage. • The presence of Ketu with the Sun often reduces the number of male lineage members, as Ketu is a moksha karaka and cuts off material continuation. • The count is probably drawn from the combined influences of debilitated Sun, Ketu, and the Moon’s aspect, but the exact number is a Nadi Siddha secret, possibly based on Nakshatra Padas or unseen subtleties in the chart that are not revealed here. • Also, Moon, a female planet, is placed in the 11th house of siblings from the 9th house of father and is aspected by two more planets Sun and Ketu. Sun may indicate a male, Ketu and Moon will refer to two females, and the presence of Moon on a male sign will give the 2nd male sibling. 2. One Member Will Get Exiled (தேசாந்திரம்): • This suggests that one member of the father’s lineage will either settle abroad or will be forced to leave his place of birth. • Ketu conjoined with the Sun often indicates detachment from homeland or karmic exile. • Additionally, the Moon in the 7th house is a powerful Kendra and a Maraka house, being directly opposite to Lagna. The 7th house from Lagna plays a significant role in Maraka events, especially when connected to the 10th lord (Moon here), aspects the Lagna where the Sun and Ketu are placed, showing forced movement or exile for one of the members. Traditional Astrology Parallel: • From the 9th house (father), the 12th house (indicating foreign lands or exile) falls in Taurus. If we assume Venus has some role in the verse (though not mentioned), it will strengthen this result. • In Nadi texts, the term ""Desanthira Yoga"" is often associated with Rahu-Ketu influences on Lagna or 9th house matters. 3. Father’s Death at the Age of 6 (Arishtam): • This is an early death prediction, and such precise timing is a specialty of Nadi. • Sun, the Pitrukaraka, is debilitated and afflicted by Ketu – a classic combination for severance of fatherly influence very early in life. • The Moon, though a benefic, becomes a Maraka for Libra Lagna as the 10th lord and is placed in the 7th house, directly aspecting the Lagna and the debilitated Sun. • Age of 6: This corresponds to the activation of the 6th house (Pisces) or the completion of the 6th year when the child enters the 7th year. In Nadi, certain houses activate specific years of life. Band of Years and Timing Logic: • The death of the father during the 6th year could correspond to the activation of the Maraka house for the father or based on the influence of the Ketu-Sun combination, which triggers separation when certain sensitive years (linked to Nakshatra Padas or Band of Years) are reached. • Also, Moon’s placement in the maraka Sthana and its aspect trigger fatality for the father during this sensitive age. Conclusion: • The number of lineage members and the exile prediction are Nadi-specialized results, partially supported by planetary positions, but the exact numerical outcome is a Siddha secret. • Father’s death at the age of 6 is fully supported by both Traditional and Nadi logic due to the debilitated Sun, Ketu’s influence, and the Maraka placement of Moon in the 7th.",Libra,Surya
Libra-04,உதையத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் தன சப்தமாதியுடன் கூடி கர்மாதிபன் பிதுர் ஸ்தானமேறியிருந்தால் தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆணிரண்டு. ஒருவன் ரோகியாயிருப்பனென்பர்.,"In Libra Lagna Pitrukaraka Sun is with the 2nd and 7th lord Mars and the 10th lord of Karma, Moon is placed in the 9th house of father, father’s family will have two members, of which one will be subjected to diseases or will be suffering from chronic disease. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage – Two Male Members: • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is in Libra with Mars, who is the 2nd and 7th lord for Libra Lagna (Scorpio and Aries ownership). • Mars is a Maraka (7th lord) and also the family lord (2nd house). His conjunction with the Sun in Libra, where the Sun is debilitated, weakens the father’s lineage and reduces the number of surviving male members. • From the 9th house (father’s house), Mars becomes the 6th and 11th lord (Cancer Lagna)—a direct connection to disease (6th house) and materialistic influences (11th house), reducing spiritual and moral continuation of the lineage. Why Only Two Male Members? • This likely comes from the fact that the Sun (Karaka for father) is debilitated, and Mars, the Maraka and Karaka for disputes and destruction, is conjoined with him. • A weak Sun combined with the aggressive and harsh influence of Mars severely restricts the prosperity of the father’s lineage. • This is further confirmed by the Moon’s placement in the 9th house (Gemini). Though Moon is a benefic, in Gemini, it becomes highly unstable (Chanchala) and materialistic, not offering strong support to the father’s house. Nadi Principle Reference: • When the Sun is afflicted by a Maraka planet (like Mars) and the 9th house receives weak or unstable planetary influences (Moon in Gemini), the lineage is weakened, and the number of surviving members is limited. 2. One Member Will Suffer from Chronic Disease (ரோகி): • Mars is a natural karaka for injuries, blood-related issues, and chronic diseases. • The placement of Mars (7th lord, Maraka) with the debilitated Sun shows that one member of the lineage will suffer from disease or face a prolonged health condition. • From the father’s perspective (9th house as Lagna), Mars becomes the 6th lord (disease lord) again (as from Gemini Lagna), further supporting this result. • Moon placed in the 9th house also plays a subtle role. The Moon represents health and fluids in the body. In Gemini, it indicates nervous system-related diseases or mental stress disorders, potentially affecting one member of the father’s family. Nadi Principle Applied: • Whenever Mars conjoins the Sun and the 6th house or its lord is involved either by ownership or placement, one member of the family typically suffers from disease. • Chronic illness is implied because Mars owns the 6th house from the 9th house of the father (Scorpio from Gemini), connecting to disease and long-term suffering in the family. Conclusion: • The result of only two male members and one being diseased is well supported by both Traditional and Nadi reasoning. • The count of “two” specifically seems to be a Nadi-specific conclusion, possibly drawn from subtle nakshatra and amsa considerations, which are not explicitly mentioned in the verse. • The presence of both Maraka (Mars) and debilitated Pitrukaraka (Sun) in the Lagna strongly indicates a weakened family structure and health issues in the father’s lineage. • Father’s Lineage Limited to Two Male Members: Partially Explainable – While the debilitated Sun and Maraka Mars reduce the lineage, the exact number “two” likely comes from hidden Nadi calculations (Nakshatra Padas or Band of Years). • One Member Suffers from Chronic Disease:  Fully Explainable – Mars as 2nd and 7th lord (Maraka), conjoined with debilitated Sun, and 6th lordship from father’s Lagna explains the disease-related suffering clearly.",Libra,Surya
Libra-05,உதையத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் பாக்கிய கர்ம விரையாதிபதிகளுடன் கூடி ஏழாமிடமேறிய திருதிய ரோகாதிபதியால் நோக்கப்பட்டால் பிதாவுடன் ஆணிரண்டு. ஜாதகன் ஜெனன முதல் தந்தைக்கு ரோகமுண்டென்பர்.,"Pitrukaraka Sun is placed in Libra Lagna and is conjoined with Moon and Mercury, and is aspected by Jupiter, placed in the 7th house, Aries. Along with the father, there will be two male members, and from the time of birth of the native, father will be disease ridden. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage – Two Male Members: • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is debilitated in Libra Lagna and conjoined with: o Moon – 10th lord (Karma) o Mercury – 9th lord (Bhagya) and 12th lord (Vyaya) • Jupiter, the 3rd and 6th lord from Libra Lagna (Sagittarius and Pisces), is placed in the 7th house (Aries) and aspects the Lagna, influencing the debilitated Sun directly. Analysis: • The sun’s debilitation already weakens the father’s position. • Mercury, being the 12th lord (Vyaya), conjoined with the Sun, indicates loss and weakness related to fatherly matters and family lineage. • Jupiter, though a benefic, owns the 6th house (disease) and 3rd house (siblings), and aspects the Sun, which brings in the disease factor and limitation in the number of surviving siblings. • Only Two Male Members: o This is linked to Jupiter’s aspect from the 7th, combining its 3rd and 6th lordship influence—limited siblings and health issues. o Sun’s debilitation further limits the strength of the lineage. o Again, the exact number “two” is a Partially Explainable result, most likely linked to hidden Nadi calculations involving the degrees of planets and Nakshatra Padas. 2. Father Will Be Disease-Ridden from the Time of the Native’s Birth: • The moment the native is born, the Sun (father) is afflicted by the Moon (10th lord) and Mercury (12th lord), both indicating mental and physical troubles. • Jupiter, as the 6th lord (disease), aspects the Sun directly from the 7th house, confirming chronic health issues for the father from the native’s birth. Why from Birth? • Nadi astrology often ties such results to the birth chart itself. • As the birth chart is cast with these afflictions already present, it signifies that the father’s suffering begins right from the native’s birth, indicating a strong karmic link. Traditional Support: • The placement of Jupiter as 6th lord aspecting the Lagna and Sun is a classical Yoga for chronic health problems to the father, especially when the father is represented by a weak Sun. • Mercury’s 12th lordship signifies continuous expenditures or efforts for treatment from the time of birth. This result is fully explainable by traditional and Nadi logic. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • This verse doesn’t directly specify an age but implies that the father’s disease starts immediately from the native’s birth. • This corresponds to the 0–1-year period for the native, activating events related to the 9th house (father) from birth itself. • Band of Years Note: The father’s disease being tied to the native’s birth is a classic case of the Prarambha Karma Band—events predetermined to unfold right at the start of life. Conclusion: • Father’s Lineage Limited to Two Male Members:  Partially Explainable – Planetary positions explain weakening of the lineage, but the exact count is likely from hidden Nadi calculations. • Father Suffering from Disease from Native’s Birth: Fully Explainable – Strong afflictions to Sun and Jupiter’s 6th lord aspect support this. • Age Activation Point: From Birth (0-1 year); Prarambha Karma Band Activated.

Father will have a normal fortune. Explanation: 1. Father Will Be Alone (தந்தை ஏகம்): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is placed alone in the 2nd house (Scorpio). • Jupiter (3rd and 6th lord) is placed in the 6th house (Pisces), and aspects the Sun. • Saturn (4th and 5th lord) is placed in the 12th house (Virgo), also aspecting the Sun. Analysis of Results: • When the Pitrukaraka Sun stands alone without conjunction, it often indicates isolation in terms of family or relationships for the father. • Jupiter’s aspect from the 6th house (disease, service, struggle) does not provide full beneficence; instead, it brings circumstantial isolation and struggle related to family matters. • Saturn’s aspect from the 12th house is highly significant. Saturn is the natural karaka for isolation, detachment, and loneliness. o Also, Saturn as the 12th house occupant (house of loss and separation) directly aspects the Sun, leading to emotional and physical isolation of the father. • From the father’s perspective (9th house as Lagna), the Sun is in the 6th house (indicating difficulties and struggles), and Saturn aspects from the 4th house of emotional happiness, restricting it. This result is fully explainable by traditional and Nadi logic. 2. Father Will Have Normal Fortune (சமயோகமுள்ளவன்): • Though the father is indicated to be alone, the verse clarifies that he will still have a balanced or normal life. • Jupiter’s aspect on the Sun, even from the 6th house, brings some positive influence, enough to avoid misfortune or extreme suffering. • Saturn, though representing detachment, is also the Yoga Karaka for Libra Lagna (owns both the 4th and 5th houses). Its aspect may introduce difficulties, but also grants balanced thinking and endurance, leading to a normal fortune rather than abject failure. Nadi Principle Applied: • When Jupiter and Saturn both influence the Sun, even if the father faces loneliness, his life remains stable due to Saturn’s karma-balancing role and Jupiter’s protective grace (even when placed in the 6th house). This result is also fully explainable by planetary logic and Nadi principles. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • No specific age is mentioned, but the placement of the Sun in the 2nd house (Scorpio) and strong Saturnine influence suggests events related to the father’s loneliness might become significant when the native’s 2nd house activates—typically between ages 24 to 26, or during a significant Saturn Dasa or Antardasa. Conclusion: • Father Will Be Alone: Fully Explainable – Strong Saturnine influence and isolated Sun indicate this result. • Father Will Have Normal Fortune: Fully Explainable – Jupiter’s aspect provides moderation, and Saturn as Yoga Karaka ensures balance despite difficulties. • Age Activation Point: Around age 24-26 (Activation of the 2nd house); Possible influence during Saturn periods.",Libra,Surya

After the age of 23 of the native, father will die. Explanation: 1. Out of Two Siblings with Father, One Will Die Young (பாலிய மரணம்): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is placed in the 2nd house (Scorpio), conjoined with: o Mars – 2nd and 7th lord (Maraka and family lord). o Mercury – 9th and 12th lord (Bhagya and Vyaya). • In the 9th house (Gemini), representing the father, Jupiter (natural benefic and karaka for progeny and lineage) and Moon (mental peace, family continuity) are placed. Analysis of Result: • The conjunction of the Sun with Mars (Maraka) and Mercury (12th lord of loss) directly indicates challenges to the father’s family, especially regarding the survival of siblings. • Though the father has two children or close siblings, one of them faces death in childhood, which is directly indicated by the strong Maraka influence (Mars) and the 12th lord’s involvement (Mercury) with the Sun. • From the father’s perspective (9th house as Lagna), the 3rd house (siblings) falls in Leo, ruled by the Sun, who is debilitated and afflicted by Mars and Mercury. This suggests one sibling cannot survive long. Nadi Principle Applied: • Whenever the Sun is debilitated and afflicted by a Maraka (Mars) and influenced by the 12th lord (Mercury), it points to the loss of a close family member, particularly a sibling. • The placement of Jupiter and the Moon in the father’s house ensures that one sibling survives and flourishes, as these two benefics give protection to the remaining sibling. This is partially explainable by planetary positions; the exact count “two” and survival of one is likely based on hidden Nadi calculations (Nakshatra Padas, Band of Years). 2. Father Will Die After the Native’s Age of 23 (இருபத்து மூன்றுக்கு மேல்): • This is a clear age activation prediction. • Age 23 typically corresponds to the activation of the 2nd house (Scorpio) and Sun-related karmas becoming prominent. • After 23, either the Dasa or Antardasa of a Maraka planet (like Mars) or a planet influencing the 9th house from Lagna gets activated. • The Sun being debilitated and afflicted by Mars and Mercury points to the father’s declining health, but his end comes only after the age of 23, indicating the father’s karmic life force sustains till then. Nadi Principle – Band of Years: • This age correlates with the completion of critical Band of Years related to the father’s karma. • The 24th year activates the 2nd house and becomes a critical period for final Maraka results related to the father. This result is fully explainable by planetary influences and Nadi timing concepts. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Father’s death occurred after the native’s age of 23. • Likely falls in the activation window of 24–26 years (when the 2nd house Scorpio becomes fully active), or during a critical Maraka Dasa/Antardasa. • This is an example of Band of Years activation for Maraka results connected to the father. Conclusion: • Out of Two Siblings, One Dies Young: Partially Explainable – Planetary positions indicate the event, but the exact count comes from hidden Nadi principles. • Father Dies After Native’s Age of 23: Fully Explainable – Clear Dasa and Band of Years-based logic supports this. • Age Activation Point: After 23 years; critical Band of Years – Activation of 2nd house and Maraka indications.",Libra,Surya

Father will be a vidwan or a learned person. Father will have defective leg. Explanation: 1. Father’s Brothers Will Be Four (சகோதரம் ஆண் நான்கு): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is in the 2nd house (Scorpio) conjoined with Mercury; the 9th and 12th lord (Bhagya and Vyaya). • Mercury is the natural karaka for intelligence, learning, and calculation, but also governs siblings when considering its lordship from specific houses. Analysis of Result: • From the 9th house (Gemini), which represents the father, the 3rd house (siblings) falls in Leo, ruled by the Sun. • Interestingly, the Sun, lord of the 3rd from the father, is placed in the 6th house (Scorpio) from the 9th house, with Mercury. • Mercury’s influence alongside the Sun typically increases the number of siblings, as Mercury naturally represents multiplicity. Why Exactly Four? • While the conjunction of Mercury and Sun does suggest more siblings, the exact number “four” is not fully deducible by classical logic alone. • This is likely based on Nadi Siddha Secrets, particularly Nakshatra Padas and Band of Years principles, not openly revealed. Partially Explainable – Planetary combination suggests multiple siblings, but the specific number is from hidden Nadi calculations. 2. Father Will Be a Vidwan (வித்வான்): • Mercury, the karaka for learning and education, is conjoined with the Sun in the 2nd house (speech, knowledge, family legacy). • The Sun, representing authority and recognition, gains strength through association with Mercury. • From the father’s chart (9th house as Lagna), the Sun is placed in the 6th house (Scorpio), but his association with Mercury suggests that the father is respected for his knowledge and intellectual pursuits despite hardships. Fully Explainable – The Mercury-Sun conjunction supports scholarly qualities. 3. Father Will Have a Defective Leg (காலூனம்): • Sun is conjoined with Mercury, the 12th lord (Vyaya), indicating physical suffering or limb-related issues. • From the father’s perspective (9th house), Sun is placed in the 6th house, a house of disease and bodily afflictions, and the placement in Scorpio (a sign associated with hidden ailments and lower limbs) directly supports this result. • Mercury, the 12th lord, is also connected with loss or weakness of physical functions. Traditional Reference: • The 6th house from the father’s Lagna is directly involved, and the placement in Scorpio emphasizes afflictions below the waist, particularly the legs. Fully Explainable – Clear planetary support for this result. 4. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • While no direct age is mentioned, the father’s health affliction (defective leg) is likely to become prominent during the native’s 24th to 26th year, corresponding to the 2nd house (where Sun and Mercury are placed). • Alternatively, if the native runs the Dasa or Antardasa of Mercury or the 12th lord, the father’s leg-related issues may surface then. Conclusion: • Father’s Brothers Will Be Four: Partially Explainable – Multiplicity is indicated, but the specific number comes from hidden Nadi secrets. • Father Will Be a Vidwan: Fully Explainable – Strong Mercury influence supports intellectual and scholarly traits. • Father Will Have Defective Leg: Fully Explainable – Classic 6th house and Scorpio affliction logic applies. • Age Activation Point: 24–26 years (Activation of the 2nd house), or during Mercury/12th lord Dasa periods.",Libra,Surya
Libra-09,"இரண்டாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் ஏகனாயிருந்து பிதுர் ஸ்தானத்தை லக்கின கேந்திரம் பெற்ற, திருதிய ரோகாதிபதியால் நோக்கப்பட்டால் தந்தை ஏகம். தர்மவான். செல்வம் அதிகாரமுண்டாம் மத்தியில் பிதாவுக்கு ரோகமுண்டென்பர்.","In the 2nd house to Libra Lagna, Sun is placed alone, and the 9th house of the father is aspected by Jupiter placed in Lagna, the father will be alone. He will be a dharmic person. He will have wealth and authority. In the middle father will be subjected to disease. Explanation: 1. Father Will Be Alone (தந்தை ஏகம்): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is placed alone in the 2nd house (Scorpio). • Jupiter is placed in the Lagna (Libra) and aspects the 9th house (Gemini), the house representing the father. Analysis of Result: • The Sun standing alone signifies isolation or lack of strong family support for the father. • Jupiter aspects the 9th house, but since he is placed in Libra (a neutral/air sign for Jupiter), the full benefic effect is somewhat reduced. • While Jupiter’s aspect provides dharmic qualities, it doesn’t directly counteract the isolation effect created by the Sun being alone. Fully Explainable – Sun alone indicates isolation, and Jupiter’s aspect does not prevent this outcome. 2. Father Will Be a Dharmic Person (தர்மவான்): • Jupiter’s aspect on the 9th house of Bhagya (Gemini) strongly supports this. • Jupiter is the natural Karaka of Dharma and righteousness, and his direct aspect on the 9th house ensures the father will follow dharmic principles and maintain a righteous character. Fully Explainable – Strong Jupiterian influence on the 9th house supports this. 3. Father Will Have Wealth and Authority (செல்வம் அதிகாரம்): • Jupiter is not only a spiritual planet but also a significator of wealth and position, especially when connected to Kendra or Trikona houses. • Jupiter placed in Lagna (a Kendra) gives dignity, respect, and financial growth through righteous means. • Although placed in Libra (not his ideal position), Jupiter’s natural beneficence is not entirely lost and still grants material comforts and social standing. Fully Explainable – Jupiter’s aspect ensures wealth and authority through dharmic means. 4. Father Will Suffer from Disease in the Middle of Life (மத்தியில் பிதாவுக்கு ரோகமுண்டு): • “Middle of life” typically refers to the age band of 30 to 50 years. • The Sun’s placement alone in the 2nd house without benefic support creates a health vulnerability for the father. • Jupiter aspects the 9th house but from Libra, where his strength is moderate, and he cannot fully prevent health issues. • This is also linked to the concept that despite leading a dharmic and prosperous life, the father faces health karma in mid-life, as a part of destiny's balancing act. Traditional Reference: • The 6th house from the father’s Lagna (9th from native) falls in Scorpio; if malefic influences are involved (though not mentioned here), this would further confirm the timing of the disease. Partially Explainable – While Jupiter’s aspect delays serious illness, the exact timing (middle life) is a Nadi Siddha indication likely derived from the Band of Years. 5. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Mid-life period (likely between 35 and 45 years) for the father’s health issues. • For the native, this aligns with the activation of the 2nd and 6th houses, which typically occur between ages 24–30 and 36–42. • Health issues for the father likely arise when the native experiences Dasa/Antardasa of malefics connected to these houses. Conclusion: • Father Will Be Alone: Fully Explainable – Isolated Sun without conjunction indicates this. • Father Will Be Dharmic: Fully Explainable – Jupiter’s aspect to the 9th house supports this. • Father Will Have Wealth and Authority: Fully Explainable – Jupiter placed in Lagna ensures this result. • Father Will Suffer Disease in Middle Life:  Partially Explainable – General timing logic supports this, but exact timing comes from hidden Nadi principles. • Age Activation Point: Father’s disease likely between ages 35–45 (native’s life); Activation of 2nd and 6th houses, possible during Jupiter’s weakened periods or Maraka Dasas.",Libra,Surya

All will be separate. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage – Four Male and Three Female Members (தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆண் நாலு, பெண் மூன்று): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) and Mercury (9th and 12th lord) are placed together in the 2nd house (Scorpio). • Saturn, the 4th and 5th lord (Yoga Karaka) for Libra Lagna, is placed in the 12th house (Virgo) and aspects the 2nd house. Analysis of Result: • Mercury’s Conjunction with the Sun: Mercury is the natural karaka for multiplicity, siblings, and progeny. His conjunction with the Sun often indicates a larger number of family members, especially in the father’s lineage. • Saturn from the 12th house aspects the 2nd house, reinforcing the karmic influence of separation and distancing within the family. Why Exactly Four Males and Three Females? • The specific number cannot be derived purely from planetary logic; it is a Partially Explainable result, likely derived from Nadi Siddha principles such as Nakshatra Padas, Band of Years, or planetary degrees, which aren’t detailed here. • However, Mercury’s association suggests a higher number of members, and Saturn’s 12th house position suggests that while the lineage exists, it is scattered or separated. 2. All Will Live Separately (தனித்தனி பிரிந்திருப்பர்): • Saturn placed in the 12th house (Vyaya Sthana) and aspecting the 2nd house (family house) directly indicates physical and emotional separation among family members. • Saturn’s natural qualities of detachment, discipline, and karmic isolation manifest here, causing the members of the father’s lineage to live separately despite being alive and connected by blood. Traditional Reference: • In Parashari astrology, the 12th house governs separation, foreign lands, and isolation. • When Saturn, the karaka for separation, aspects family-related houses (2nd house here), it leads to the members being scattered, living separately, or emotionally distanced, even if under the same roof. This result is fully explainable by planetary logic. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Though no specific age is mentioned, separation among family members is typically realized after the native enters adulthood, often during the 24–30 years age window, when the 2nd house (Scorpio) becomes active. • During the Dasa or Antardasa of Saturn (representing karmic separation) or Mercury (connected to family matters), this separation becomes pronounced. Conclusion: • Father’s Lineage – Four Male and Three Female Members: Partially Explainable – Multiplicity is indicated by Mercury, but the exact number is drawn from hidden Nadi calculations. • Family Members Will Be Separate: Fully Explainable – Strong 12th house Saturn influence and its aspect on the 2nd house justify this clearly. • Age Activation Point: Separation realized around ages 24–30 or during Saturn’s Dasa/Antardasa.

At the age of 43 of the native Father will die. Explanation: 1. Father Will Have Two Wives (தாரமிரண்டு): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is placed alone in the 3rd house (Sagittarius). • Jupiter, the 3rd and 6th lord, is placed in the 5th house (Aquarius), aspecting the 9th house (Gemini), which represents the father. Analysis of Result: • The Sun placed alone indicates that the father, despite limited strong relationships, may have multiple marital ties due to unsettled family life or karmic reasons. • Jupiter’s placement in the 5th house (Aquarius), a trine and a Kama trikona house, and its direct aspect on the 9th house, activates the father’s karmic tendencies related to relationships. • Aquarius, being a sign ruled by Saturn and co-ruled by Rahu (per Nadi traditions), is known for unconventional or multiple relationships. • In Nadi, when the 9th house is aspected by Jupiter from a Kama Trikona (5th, 7th, or 11th house), and the Sun stands alone, it is often indicative of multiple marriages or relationships for the father. • Jupiter in the 5th house aspecting the 9th house of father's good fortune and marital status is a classical Nadi indication for the father having two wives. • The Sun in the 3rd house in Sagittarius further strengthens this by emphasizing parental and marital themes. Fully Explainable – Classical Nadi and Traditional astrological reasoning both support this. 2. Father Will Die When the Native is 43 Years Old (நாற்பத்து மூன்றில் பிதா மரணமாவன்): • This is a precise age prediction, characteristic of Nadi timing through the Band of Years or Nakshatra Padas. • The age of 43 typically corresponds to the activation of the 9th house (father’s house) or the native entering into a Maraka Dasa/Antardasa connected to the Sun or Jupiter. Band of Years Activation: • Age 43 is the time when the 5th and 9th house activation periods coincide in advanced Nadi timing methods, often triggering karmic events related to the father. • If the native enters a Dasa or Antardasa of Jupiter (as the 6th lord—disease and end of life significations) or Sun (Pitrukaraka), this timing becomes critical. Partially Explainable – While the planetary positions suggest a possible timeframe, the exact age “43” is likely derived from deeper Nadi calculations not fully evident from planetary positions alone. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Critical Activation at Age 43. • Likely linked to the native’s Dasa/Antardasa of Sun, Jupiter, or Maraka lords, and the triggering of the Band of Years associated with the 9th house. Conclusion: • Father Will Have Two Wives: Fully Explainable – Jupiter’s trinal aspect and Sun’s isolation support this result. • Father Will Die at Native’s Age of 43: Partially Explainable – Precise age prediction likely based on Band of Years or Nakshatra Padas not fully derived from the given chart. • Age Activation Point: Definitive event at age 43; activation of 9th house Band of Years and related Maraka Dasas.",Libra,Surya

There will be two males and two females. The eldest will be handicapped and will have no progeny, and the father will have a comfortable life. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage Will Be Long-Lasting (தீர்க்கம்): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is placed in the 3rd house (Sagittarius) along with Mars, the 7th lord (Maraka) and 2nd lord (family lord) for Libra Lagna. • Jupiter, the 3rd and 6th lord, is placed in the 9th house (Gemini). Analysis: • The Sun’s placement in a 3rd house along with Mars indicates a strong karmic lineage but with some struggles. • Jupiter, the planet of expansion and continuation of lineage, is placed directly in the 9th house of the father, suggesting a strong and enduring family line despite some issues. • In Nadi, Jupiter’s placement in the 9th house is a powerful indicator of the continuation and longevity of the family lineage, especially when not afflicted by malefics. Fully Explainable – Jupiter’s placement ensures the continuity of the father’s lineage. 2. Two Male and Two Female Members in Father’s Lineage (ஆணிரண்டு, பெண்ணிரண்டு): • Mars (7th lord) conjoined with the Sun generally increases the family size due to Mars’ aggressive and multiplying nature. • Mercury’s absence in this verse suggests that while there is multiplicity, it is kept in balance at exactly four members. Partially Explainable – Planetary logic shows an increase in family size, but the exact count “two males and two females” likely comes from hidden Nadi calculations (Nakshatra Padas, planetary degrees). 3. Eldest Will Be Handicapped (ஜேஷ்டன் முடவன்): • From the father’s perspective (9th house Gemini), the 11th house (elder sibling’s house) is Aries, ruled by Mars. • Mars, the lord of Aries, is conjoined with the Sun in the 3rd house, indicating karmic affliction to the eldest sibling. • In Nadi Astrology, when Mars and Sun are together and there is no benefic influence, it often indicates physical disability or limb-related issues for the eldest sibling. • Mars is also the karaka for the limbs, and when afflicted or conjoined with a debilitated Sun, it directly suggests such outcomes. Fully Explainable – The Mars and Sun conjunction is a classical indicator for this result. 4. Eldest Will Have No Progeny (சந்ததி அற்றவன்): • Mars, being the lord of the 7th house and representing reproductive energy, is conjoined with a debilitated Sun, which naturally limits progeny. • From the perspective of the elder sibling (Aries Lagna for the eldest), the 5th house (Leo) is ruled by the Sun, who is debilitated and afflicted by Mars—this directly blocks progeny. Fully Explainable – Sun’s debilitation and Mars's affliction deny progeny for the eldest. 5. Father Will Have a Comfortable Life (பிதா சுகமடைவன்): • Jupiter, the greatest benefic, is placed in the 9th house (house of the father), ensuring the father enjoys comfort and prosperity, despite karmic struggles around his children. • This placement indicates Bhagya Sudhi—cleansing of misfortunes and resulting in comfort. Fully Explainable – Jupiter’s position in the 9th house ensures the father’s well-being. 6. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Although no specific age is given, issues related to the eldest sibling’s disability and lack of progeny would manifest during the native’s 30–36 years period, when the 3rd house and related karmas are fully active. • Father’s comfort is experienced throughout his middle and later life, particularly after the native’s age of 30+, aligning with the activation of the 9th house (Gemini) and its associated Band of Years. Conclusion: • Father’s Lineage Will Be Long-Lasting: Fully Explainable – Jupiter’s placement strongly supports this. • Two Male and Two Female Members: Partially Explainable – Planetary logic suggests multiplicity, but the exact numbers likely come from Nadi Siddha principles. • Eldest Will Be Handicapped: Fully Explainable – Mars and Sun affliction indicate this. • Eldest Will Have No Progeny: Fully Explainable – Debilitated Sun and afflicted 5th house from the elder sibling’s perspective justify this. • Father Will Have a Comfortable Life: Fully Explainable – Jupiter in the 9th house ensures this result. • Age Activation Point: 30–36 years (Activation of 3rd house karmas and 9th house prosperity for the father).",Libra,Surya

Father’s Lineage – Two Male Members (தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆணிருவர்): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) and Mercury (9th and 12th lord) are placed together in the 3rd house (Sagittarius). • Jupiter, the 3rd and 6th lord (siblings and disease), is placed in the 11th house (Leo) and aspects the 3rd house (Sagittarius). Analysis of Result: • Jupiter’s placement in the 11th house, a Kama Trikona and the house of elder siblings, influences family expansion but also limits it when combined with his ownership of the 6th house (disease and loss). • The Sun and Mercury conjunction often limits the strength and expansion of lineage due to Mercury’s 12th lordship (Vyaya) and the Sun’s natural karaka role being weakened by Mercury’s proximity. • Jupiter, although aspecting from the 11th house (favourable for gains), also brings the influence of his 6th house ownership, which limits the continuation of the family line. Partially Explainable – The limiting effect is clear, but the exact number “two male members” is based on hidden Nadi principles (likely Nakshatra Padas or Amsa divisions). 2. Father Excelling in Tastes (பிதா சுவையில் மேம்பட்டவன்): • This refers to the father having refined tastes—possibly in food, arts, or material pleasures. • Mercury, the karaka for intellectual refinement and sensual pleasures, conjoined with the Sun in a fire sign (Sagittarius), leads to an enhanced interest in refined experiences. • Additionally, Jupiter’s aspect from Leo (a royal and luxurious sign) enhances material enjoyment and taste for fine things. • From the father’s perspective (9th house as Lagna), the Lagna lord is Mercury, placed in Sagittarius (a sign of dharma and enjoyment), directly indicating a love for higher enjoyments, good taste, and refinement. Fully Explainable – Mercury and Jupiter’s influence directly supports refined tastes. 3. Father Will Suffer from Rheumatism (வாத ரோகம்): • Rheumatism is often linked to Vata Dosha imbalance, which is classically associated with Mercury and Saturn influences, and afflictions from air signs or fiery conditions that dry up body fluids. • Here: o Mercury, the karaka for nervous system and imbalances, is conjoined with the Sun (who governs vitality and the bones). o Jupiter, the 6th lord of diseases, aspects the conjunction from Leo, a fiery sign, aggravating Vata (air element) imbalances, leading to rheumatism. • From the father’s Lagna (9th house as Lagna), this combination triggers chronic nerve and joint-related diseases. Fully Explainable – Clear connection to classic astrological reasoning for Vata-related diseases like rheumatism. 4. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Although no specific age is given, the father’s health issues related to rheumatism are likely to become prominent during the native’s 30–36 years, corresponding to the activation of the 3rd house karmas. • Dasa/Antardasa periods of Mercury, Sun, or Jupiter (especially Jupiter, as the 6th lord) will likely trigger health events for the father. Conclusion: • Father’s Lineage Limited to Two Male Members:  Partially Explainable – Limiting influences are present, but the exact number is a Nadi Siddha secret. • Father Excelling in Tastes: Fully Explainable – Mercury and Jupiter’s influences account for refined tastes. • Father Suffers from Rheumatism: Fully Explainable – Mercury-Sun affliction with Jupiter’s 6th house aspect leads to chronic Vata-related issues. • Age Activation Point: 30–36 years; Dasa/Antardasa of Mercury, Sun, or Jupiter likely triggers father’s health issues.",Libra,Surya

It is said that the father will pass away in the thirty-first year. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage – Two Members (பிதுர் வர்க்கம் இருவர்): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is placed in the 3rd house (Sagittarius) along with Mercury, the lord of the 9th house (Gemini) — the house of the father. • The verse mentions that a benefic planet connected to the 9th house is under the influence of the 5th and 6th lords. Sun + Mercury in 3H (Sagittarius): • Sun (Pitru Karaka) with Mercury (9L) in 3H suggests: o Strong karmic linkage to father’s lineage. o Mercury owns 9H → Its association with the Sun here is significant for triggering karma relating to the father’s longevity and lineage. o 3H is 8th from 8th — a transformation house → when linked with Pitru Karaka, it often reduces lineage strength → matches result ""2 members in lineage.” Saturn + Jupiter in 9H (Gemini): • Saturn is 5L (Purva Punya) + 6L (disease, obstacles). • Jupiter brings both beneficence (as natural benefic, karaka of lineage/progeny) and karmic balancing (since here 9H is under double influence): o Saturn in 9H introduces reduction or obstruction in the father’s fortune and longevity (Saturn as 6L influencing 9H = disease, obstacles to the father). o Jupiter in 9H gives some preservation of dharma but is weakened by Saturn's presence. o The combination of 9H signals weak protection to father’s longevity → matches ""father will die at 31."" Birth during the Dasa of the 11th lord Sun: • Sun is Pitru Karaka + 11th lord. • The Dasa of the 11th lord is strongly linked to activation of father’s karma (Sun itself is placed with Mercury — 9L → double pitru triggers). • Sun’s natural Maraka role on the father is thus highlighted. → The father’s death in Sun Dasa is karmically natural here. Death timing — age 31: • Age 31 → transition into 6H Band (31–36): o Saturn as 6L placed in 9H is exactly the cause here: • 6L Saturn → disease, exit triggers. • Placement in 9H → targeting father’s well-being. • Activation of this Saturn influence during Sun Dasa explains the father’s death at 31. Lineage limited to 2 members: • Sun + Mercury in 3H → 3H being the house of siblings/lineage strength. • With Saturn’s obstruction on 9H, and Mercury being trapped with the Sun in 3H, lineage cannot grow much. → Only 2 members remain. Final Reasoning Summary: • Sun + Mercury in 3H = karmic trigger for father’s lineage limitation. • Saturn (5L, 6L) + Jupiter in 9H: o Saturn as 6L brings disease to the father. o Jupiter tries to preserve dharma but is afflicted. • Dasa of Sun (11L + Pitru Karaka) triggers father’s karmic death. • Age 31 matches 6H Band, which Saturn controls → death fully explained. • 3H + 9H influences explain lineage limited to 2 members. Father Will Die in the Thirty-First Year (முப்பத்தொன்றில் பிதா மரணமாவன்): • This is a precise age-based prediction characteristic of Nadi Astrology. • The 31st year typically activates the native’s 11th house (Leo), which is a Maraka Sthana for the father when considering the Lagna as Libra. • The 11th house lord is Sun, who is debilitated and afflicted in this case, pointing towards a critical period related to the father’s longevity. Band of Years Activation: • The 11th house is also a Badhakasthana for Libra Lagna, and the Dasa/Antardasa of the 11th lord Sun or its connected planets can cause the father’s death during this period. • The activation of Maraka and Badhaka effects during the 31st year makes this a critical period for the father’s departure. Partially Explainable – The planetary conditions support a critical event around this time, but the precise age “31” comes from Nadi Siddha Secrets and advanced Band of Years calculations. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Father’s death is predicted at age 31, indicating a critical Maraka/Badhaka period activation. • Most likely, this aligns with the native entering the Dasa or Antardasa of the Sun (11th lord) or planets influencing the 9th house. Conclusion: • Father’s Lineage Limited to Two Members: Partially Explainable – Planetary logic shows limitation, but the exact number “two” is from hidden Nadi principles. • Father Will Die in the 31st Year: Partially Explainable – Event timing aligns with house activations, but exact age is likely derived from Band of Years and Nakshatra Pada-based calculations. • Age Activation Point: Definitive event at age 31 (Activation of 11th house Maraka and Badhaka effects, likely during Sun Dasa/Antardasa).",Libra,Surya

The father may suffer from a severe affliction related to poison, and it is said that he will face death after the age of thirty for the native. Suggested Wording for the Book (Nadi Principle): ""When the Pitru Karaka Sun is conjoined with the 6th lord Jupiter in the 3rd house, the father's lineage is restricted to one female offspring. The father will possess a poisonous or harmful nature, indicated by the afflicted Jupiter-Sun combination influencing communication and moral behaviour. The father's death is likely to occur after the native reaches age 30, corresponding to the activation of the 6th house Band of Years."" Explanation: Planetary Positions: One female Alongside Father (தந்தையுடன் பெண்ணொன்று விர்த்தி): • Sun (Pitru Karaka) + Jupiter (6L) in 3H. • 3H is siblings/offspring linked to father’s family (3rd house from 9H of father = 11H → shows siblings or expansion of father’s lineage). • Jupiter rules both 6th (disease/obstacle) and 3rd (Sagittarius). Why one female? • Jupiter (natural karaka of children) is blocked by its 6L role, limiting progeny. • The presence of the Sun (male fiery planet) with Jupiter prevents the broad expansion of the lineage. • The combination supports the birth of a single offspring, and the female result likely comes from Nadi Nakshatra-based reasoning (Jupiter’s feminine tendency when afflicted). Partially explainable — planetary logic supports limitation; specific gender likely Nadi-based. Father Is a Poisonous Person (பிதா விஷ கண்டனாய்): • This is behavioural / character-related, not medical. How do planets indicate this? • Jupiter as 6L represents enmity, moral lapses, unethical behaviour when afflicted. • Sun combusting Jupiter in 3H → pride, arrogance, harsh speech (3H rules speech/communication). • Sagittarius is a fiery, ideological sign. → Afflicted Jupiter in Sagittarius can cause distorted belief systems or morally harmful behaviour. • The result Visha Kandan metaphorically indicates a person who harms others through words, deeds, or manipulation — i.e., a ""poisonous nature,"" not a poisoned body. Fully explainable — strong character indication from Sun + 6L Jupiter in 3H. Father Dies After Native Reaches Age 30: • Father’s death is what the verse says (பிதா மரணமாவன்) → not native’s death. Why after 30? • Age 30 → entry into 5H Band (25–30 ending) → start of 6H Band (31–36). • 6H Band perfectly aligns with Jupiter (6L) influence. • Sun + 6L Jupiter conjunction shows karmic activation of father's death during the 6H Band. • The fact that the father’s karmic triggers activate after the native crosses 30 fits Nadi logic. Fully explainable — Band of Years activation + Jupiter’s 6L role causes the father's death. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • After the age of 30 of the native — 6H Band activation. • Likely trigger: father dies during Jupiter or Sun Dasa or Antardasa during this period. Final Conclusion (Corrected): Result Explanation One female was born alongside the father. Partially explainable — lineage limitation supported; exact number from Nadi principle. Father is a poisonous person (character-wise) Fully explainable — 6L Jupiter + Sun in 3H gives arrogance, harmful speech, and negative character traits. Father dies after the native reaches the age of 30 Fully explainable — 6H Band activation + 6L Jupiter conjunction triggers father’s death.

It is said that the father will pass away at the age of thirty-seven under unfortunate circumstances. Explanation: 1. Father Will Suffer from Chronic Illness (பிதாரோகி): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is placed in the 4th house (Capricorn), conjoined with: o Mars – 2nd and 7th lord (Maraka) o Mercury – 9th and 12th lord (Bhagya and Vyaya) o Saturn – 8th lord (Ashtamaadhipathi) Analysis of Result: • The 4th house, generally associated with emotional peace and physical comforts, is heavily afflicted by these malefics and functional malefics. • Saturn’s presence as the 8th lord brings chronic, lingering diseases, particularly related to karma from past lives. • Mercury’s 12th lordship adds the element of hospitalization, expenses, and long-term suffering. • Mars, as the 7th lord (Maraka) and a natural malefic, adds vitality loss and increases the risk of life-threatening chronic ailments. From the father's perspective (9th house as Lagna): • The Sun is placed in the 8th house (a house of disease and longevity challenges), directly indicating prolonged illness. Fully Explainable – Clear afflictions and lordship combinations justify chronic health issues for the father. 2. Father Will Die at the Age of 37 Under Unfortunate Circumstances (முப்பத்தேழில் மரண கெண்ட முண்டு): • The age of 37 typically corresponds to the activation of the 4th house (Capricorn) and its karmas. • The 4th house is heavily afflicted and becomes active around this period, often bringing results related to emotional, familial, or life-related closures. • Karmaadhipathi (10th lord) is Moon, who aspects the 9th house (father’s house), indicating that the karmic debt related to the father reaches culmination at this point. • The combination of the 8th lord, Saturn, and Maraka lord Mars influences ensures this is a critical period for the father’s end of life. Band of Years Activation: • The 37th year corresponds to the completion of a full cycle of karmic effects related to the 4th house, as per Band of Years principles. • Likely, the native would also be running a Maraka Dasa/Antardasa (Mars, Saturn, or Mercury) at this time, triggering the father’s death. Partially Explainable – The timing aligns with house activations and dasa sequences, but the precise age “37” is based on hidden Nadi timing principles. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Father’s death predicted at the age of 37. • Likely period of activation of the 4th house karmas, or during the native’s Dasa/Antardasa of Mars (Maraka), Saturn (8th lord), or Mercury (12th lord). Conclusion: • Father Will Suffer from Chronic Illness: Fully Explainable – Clear planetary afflictions justify this outcome. • Father Will Die at Age 37 Under Unfortunate Circumstances: Partially Explainable – Timing aligns with house and dasa activations, but exact age comes from Band of Years. • Age Activation Point: Definitive event at age 37; Activation of 4th house karmas and Maraka influences.",Libra,Surya

Among Three Members of Father’s Lineage, One Will Die in Midlife (தந்தை வர்க்க மூன்றில் ஒருவன் மத்திய கால மரணம்): • Sun (Pitrukaraka) is placed in the 4th house (Capricorn) conjoined with: o Mercury – 9th and 12th lord (Bhagya and Vyaya) o Moon – 10th lord (Karmaadhipathi) • The combination is aspected by a planet placed in the 8th house (Taurus), who is under the influence of the 3rd and 6th house lords—this refers to Jupiter exerting an influence. Analysis: • The Sun conjoined with Mercury and Moon represents a highly karmic setup affecting the father’s lineage. • Mercury as the 12th lord adds loss and separation tendencies; the Moon as the 10th lord brings karma and fate into the picture. • The aspect from the 8th house (a house of longevity challenges and sudden events), coupled with the influences of Jupiter (3rd lord of siblings and 6th lord of disease), ensures that one among the three members of the father’s lineage faces death during midlife. Partially Explainable – Planetary combinations justify limitation and death, but the exact number “three members” and “one dying in midlife” is based on hidden Nadi calculations (Nakshatra Padas and Band of Years). 2. Father Will Have Strong Fortune (பிதா பாக்கிய முள்ளவன்): • Despite lineage limitations, the father himself is indicated to have strong Bhagya (fortune). • Mercury (9th lord) conjoined with the Sun and Moon in the Kendra (4th house) indicates that the father experiences good fortune, prosperity, and general well-being, even amidst challenges. • From the father’s perspective (9th house Gemini as Lagna), Mercury becomes the Lagna lord and is placed well, reinforcing strong luck and fortune for the father. Fully Explainable – Mercury’s strong placement and connection to Bhagya ensure good fortune for the father. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Though no specific age is mentioned for the death of the father’s relative, the term “midlife demise” typically refers to the period between 30–50 years. • The native’s karmic house activations around ages 30–42 (connected to the 4th house) may trigger events affecting the father’s lineage. Conclusion: • One Out of Three Members Will Die in Midlife:  Partially Explainable – Strong planetary indications for reduction in lineage, but the exact number and timing are based on hidden Nadi principles. • Father Will Have Strong Fortune:  Fully Explainable – Mercury’s placement and strong Bhagya lordship support this result. • Age Activation Point: Father’s lineage affected around native’s age of 30–42 years; Activation of 4th house karmas or during Mercury/Sun Dasa periods.",Libra,Surya

It is said that the father will experience both hardships and comforts throughout his life. Explanation: Father’s Lineage — 3 males, 1 female Planetary basis: • Sun + Mercury in 4H → father’s karma and fate are already active (4H is a Kendra — major life foundation). • 9H (father’s house) receives: o Saturn’s aspect → restricts expansion of progeny / lineage. o Jupiter’s aspect → ensures some progeny and favours male children (Jupiter is male karaka). o Venus’s aspect → brings female element in lineage and enhances the family’s desire for pleasure/comfort. How this explains 3 males, 1 female: • Saturn’s aspect limits total number — prevents a large family. • Jupiter ensures at least 2–3 male children → Jupiter’s aspect supports continuation of male line. • Venus adds 1 female — Venus generally adds 1 or 2 female influences; here, limited by Saturn → gives 1 female. planetary influences logically explain 3 males, 1 female. Father experiences both hardship and comfort (கஷ்ட சுகம்): How is this shown? • Saturn’s aspect → brings restrictions, delays, and hardships in the father’s life: o Financial pressures o Health concerns o Obstacles in career or family happiness • Jupiter’s aspect → provides wisdom, occasional good fortune, and dharmic support: o Father may find support from teachers, spiritual sources. o Occasional bursts of fortune despite hardship. • Venus’s aspect → ensures that despite Saturn’s restriction, the father still enjoys some comforts: o Artistic inclinations o Pleasures of life (though moderated) o Comfort through relationships and family at certain phases. Combined: Mixed life → father faces struggles (Saturn) but enjoys certain comforts (Venus + Jupiter). Summary of Nadi Principle (for your book): ""When the Pitru Karaka Sun is conjoined with the 9th and 12th lord Mercury in the 4th house, and the ancestral house is aspected by Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus, the father's lineage is restricted to three males, 1 female. The mixed influences of Saturn (hardships), Jupiter (fortune), and Venus (comfort) result in the father experiencing both suffering and enjoyment throughout his life.""",Libra,Surya

It is said that the ancestors will live separately, apart from one another. Explanation: Father’s Lineage — 4 males, 3 females • Mars aspect → supports strong male births → tendency toward 4 male members. • Mercury + Ketu → adds mixed influence → allows female progeny but also contributes to disunity. • Saturn’s aspect on 4H: o Saturn as the karaka of restriction limits the overall number of children but still allows a reasonable size of lineage here (4 males, 3 females). o Saturn's cold, detached influence reduces unity, but not the count. o Its 7th aspect stabilizes the number — allows for a structured family number (not too large, not too small). Combined logic → 4 males, 3 females are very well supported: • Mars → favours males. • Mercury + Ketu → adds females + fragmentation tendency. • Saturn → allows a structured family, limits excessive expansion. Ancestors will live separately (தனித் தனி பிரிந்திருப்பர்): • Ketu in 4H → classic separation indicator in Nadi. • Mercury → adds restlessness, mental and relational instability → promotes disunity. • Mars aspect → introduces aggression, disputes. • Saturn’s 7th aspect → adds coldness, detachment: o Strongly supports the idea that the family members will remain emotionally or physically separate. o In Nadi principles, Saturn + Ketu influences on 4H always reduce family cohesion. Combination of Ketu + Mercury + Mars + Saturn aspect → makes it highly logical that ancestors live separately. Final Nadi Principle ""When the Pitru Karaka Sun is placed in the 4th house along with Mercury and Ketu, and this combination is aspected by Mars from the Lagna and Saturn from the 10th house, the father's lineage will include four male and three female members.

It is said that the father will earn his livelihood through knowledge and skills. Explanation: Father’s Lineage — 2 stable male members: How planetary configuration explains this: • Mercury + Venus with Sun → naturally supports learning, arts, skills in the family line, but not uncontrolled expansion. • Kendra positions → stability in karma, but also limitations. Aspects from 10H: • Moon’s aspect: o Brings nourishment and supports stability, but is also changeable → explains why only 2 males remain stable — others may not survive or stay connected. • Mars’ aspect: o Introduces conflict, aggression, and reduces overall cohesion of the family → further limiting expansion of the male line. o Mars’ role explains why only 2 males stabilize — others face karmic reduction (through conflict, obstacles). • Jupiter’s aspect: o Supports preservation of dharma and skills → hence 2 male members remain stable and survive to carry on the family tradition. o Without Jupiter’s protection, even the 2 may not have remained. Net result → planetary logic strongly supports the lineage of 2 stable males: • Mercury + Venus → supports education and refined qualities, but limited expansion. • Mars + Moon aspects → restrict expansion, cause instability for other male members. • Jupiter aspect → protects at least 2 stable males in the lineage. Father earns a livelihood through knowledge and skills: How is this shown? • Mercury (Budhan) → karaka for knowledge, intellect, skills → directly in 4H with Sun + Venus. • Venus → supports arts, fine skills, and refined abilities. • Moon aspect → enhances memory and learning abilities. • Jupiter aspect → further strengthens teaching, advisory, and scholarly skills. Hence, the combination of Mercury + Venus + Jupiter aspect is a classic Nadi combination for earning a livelihood through knowledge and skills: • Teaching, scholarship, arts, or advisory roles — father uses mental/intellectual abilities for income. Final Nadi Principle: ""When the Pitru Karaka Sun is placed in the 4th house along with Mercury and Venus, and is aspected by the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter from the 10th house, the father’s lineage will have two stable male members. The combined influence of Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter indicates that the father will earn his livelihood through knowledge, skills, or intellectual pursuits, while the aspects of Mars and Moon contribute to limiting the expansion of the male lineage.""

It is said that the native will earn a livelihood through land and property. Planetary Position: Libra Lagna, Saturn in 3rd house, Sun in 5th house – Saturn aspects Sun Explanation: 1. Father Will Have Mental Instability from Native’s Birth (ஜாதகன் ஜெனன முதல் தந்தைக்கு சித்த பிரமையுண்டாம்) • The Sun alone in the 5th house in Aquarius, an airy and Saturnine sign, makes it vulnerable, especially when aspected by Saturn. • Saturn, although a Yoga Karaka for Libra Lagna, becomes mentally suppressive when aspecting the Sun. It causes psychological pressure, emotional rigidity, and karmic burdens. • From the father’s perspective (9th house as Lagna): o The Sun is in the 9th from the 9th (i.e., 5th from native) → Indicates the Putra Bhava of the father, i.e., the native himself. o Saturn’s aspect indicates a karmic debt connected with the native, triggering mental distress in the father beginning from the native’s birth. Fully Explainable – Classical and Nadi logic confirm mental instability through Saturn’s hostile aspect on a lonely Sun, especially in Aquarius. 2. Native Will Earn Livelihood Through Land/Property (ஜாதகன் பூமி மூலம் ஜீவிப்பன்) • Saturn is the 4th lord (house of land, real estate, and immovable property) and is placed in the 3rd house (effort, initiative). • It aspects the 5th house, where the Sun is placed, connecting intellect, self-expression, and personal power to land-based wealth. • This combination shows the native putting in effort (3rd house Saturn) toward property-linked income, including: o Agricultural land o Rental income o Real estate business o Construction or land development • In Nadi, Saturn influencing the Sun from the 3rd to 5th axis is often interpreted as land karma carried over—the native inherits or develops income through land or buildings. Fully Explainable – Saturn's dual role as 4th lord and aspect from the 3rd strongly supports land-based earnings. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • The 5th house (Aquarius) activates around age 30–36. • Mental affliction of the father begins at birth, but deteriorates during the native’s 30s, possibly aligning with the Dasa/Antardasa of Saturn or Sun. • The native's property-related karma begins yielding visible results between ages 33–36, depending on Dasa timing. Conclusion for Verse 21 • Father’s Mental Instability from Native’s Birth:  Fully Explainable – Sun alone in Aquarius aspected by Saturn supports this entirely. • Native Earns Through Land/Property: Fully Explainable – Saturn as 4th lord in 3rd aspecting 5th house Sun confirms this outcome. • Age Activation Point: Mental issues start at birth; property karma matures during age 30–36, especially in Saturn or Sun periods.",Libra,Surya

It is said that the father will face an unfortunate demise at the age of twenty-five. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage – Four males and Two females (தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆண் நான்கு, பெண் இரண்டு): • Mercury’s conjunction signifies multiplicity, and as the 9th lord, promotes the continuation of the paternal line. • Mars, while a Maraka, is also the 2nd lord (family expansion), and his presence with Mercury and the Sun in the 5th house shows a large family structure, especially male-dominated due to Mars. • Jupiter, although a benefic, acts as 3rd (siblings) and 6th (disease/obstacle) lord, and his aspect from the 11th (Labha) house ensures material growth and wider family expansion, but not without karmic tension. Partially Explainable – Planetary combinations justify a larger lineage, but the specific number “4 males and 2 females” comes from deeper Nadi Siddha calculations, possibly from Nakshatra Padas. 2. Father Will Die at Age 25 – Marana Kendam (இருபத்தைந்தில் தந்தைக்கு மரணகெண்டம்): • Age 25 corresponds to the activation of the 5th house (Aquarius), where Sun (Pitrukaraka) is placed and is afflicted by both Maraka (Mars) and 12th lord (Mercury). • Jupiter (6th lord) aspects this combination from the 11th house, a Badhakasthana for Libra Lagna, adding Maraka potential. • These combined influences during the 25th year form a perfectly timed fatal trigger as per Nadi Band of Years. Classical confirmation: • Mars (7th lord – Maraka) + Mercury (12th lord – loss) + Jupiter (6th lord – disease) all interact with the Sun. • Activation of the 5th house Band of Years (generally ages 24–27) explains why this year is fatal for the father. Partially Explainable – While fatal combinations exist, the exact year “25” is likely derived through advanced Nadi timing (Band of Years, Pada activation). 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 25 is critical for: o Activation of 5th house (Aquarius) karmas o Presence of Maraka + Vyaya lords with Sun o Aspect of 6th and 3rd lord (Jupiter) from Badhakasthana (11th house) Conclusion for Verse 22 • Father’s Lineage: Four males and two females:  Partially Explainable – Planetary logic shows family expansion, but the exact count is from Nadi secrets. • Father’s Death at Age 25: Partially Explainable – Dasa and house activations support timing, but the exact age is likely from Band of Years calculations. • Age Activation Point: 25 years; 5th house Band of Years + strong Maraka and Badhaka triggers through Mars, Mercury, and Jupiter.",Libra,Surya
Libra-23,"ஐந்தாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் ஏகனாய் நின்று பதினோராமிடத்திலிருக்கும் சுக, பஞ்சமாதிபதியால் பார்க்கப் பட்டால் தந்தை நாற்பது வரை தீர்க்கம். பிதாவுடன் பொருந்த மாட்டானென்பர்.","For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed alone in the fifth house and aspected by the lords of the fourth house (Sukha) and fifth house (Panchama)-Saturn positioned in the eleventh house, then the father will have longevity up to forty years. It is said that the native will not have harmony with the father. Explanation: 1. Father Will Live Up to Age 40 (தந்தை நாற்பது வரை தீர்க்கம்): • Sun placed alone in Aquarius indicates a weakened support system for the father, especially when not supported by benefics. • Saturn, although a Yoga Karaka for Libra Lagna, becomes karmically strong and rigid when placed in the 11th house (Leo) and aspecting the Sun. • Saturn is also the natural Ayushkaraka (significator of longevity). When it aspects the Sun (karaka for father), it defines the life span based on karmic necessity. • The 40th year typically corresponds to activation of the 11th house Band of Years and may coincide with Saturn’s Dasa or Antardasa, becoming Maraka through Badhakasthana (11th house for Libra Lagna). Partially Explainable – Saturn’s aspect and timing logic support a midlife death, but the specific cutoff at “40” is a Nadi timing-based prediction (Band of Years or Nakshatra-based). 2. Native Will Not Have Harmony with Father (பிதாவுடன் பொருந்த மாட்டான்): • The Sun and Saturn are mutual enemies. Here, Saturn aspects the Sun—a classic configuration for ego clash, disconnect, and karmic tension between father and son. • Saturn in the 11th house (a Badhakasthana) exerts karmic delay and restriction on the father-son relationship. • From the father’s perspective (9th house Gemini as Lagna), the Sun (native) is in the 9th house from father, and Saturn aspects him from the 3rd—a placement that causes mental and emotional dissonance. Fully Explainable – Saturn’s hostile aspect on an isolated Sun classically causes strained paternal relationships. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • 40th year aligns with the 11th house activation (Leo) and possible Saturn Dasa/Antardasa. • This becomes a karmic checkpoint for the father’s longevity. Conclusion for Verse 23 • Father’s Longevity Up to Age 40: Partially Explainable—Saturn’s influence defines lifespan, but the exact age comes from the Nadi Band of Years. • No Harmony with Father: Fully Explainable – Saturn’s aspect on Sun is a textbook case of father-son disconnect. • Age Activation Point: 40 years; activation of 11th house Band of Years and Saturn Dasa likely involved. Note: Let’s clarify the confusion by comparing the BCP (Bhrighu Chakra Paddhati) system with the Nadi Band of Years concept, which may be at play in this verse. Bhrighu Chakra Paddhati (BCP) Activation: • In BCP, each year corresponds to a house, progressing from Lagna. • So: o Age 1 → 1st house o Age 2 → 2nd house o … o Age 40 → 4th house Therefore, per BCP, the 4th house (Capricorn) is activated at age 40. Why Was the 11th House Mentioned in the Verse Analysis? In the verse, Saturn (4th and 5th lord) is placed in the 11th house (Leo) and aspects the 5th house Sun. The reference to the 11th house was not for BCP-style activation, but for: • Saturn being in Badhakasthana (for Libra Lagna, 11th house is the Badhaka). • The event (father’s death at 40) possibly being triggered during Saturn’s Dasa or Antardasa, which is placed in the 11th. So, the earlier phrasing about ""activation of 11th house"" was an interpretative overreach. Corrected View: • BCP Activation at Age 40: 4th House (Capricorn) • Sun is placed in the 5th (Aquarius) and aspected by Saturn from the 11th (Leo) • Saturn is 4th and 5th lord → Activation of 4th house (BCP age 40) brings Saturn’s karma into play. • Father’s end at age 40 is due to: o BCP activation of 4th house, ruled by Saturn, who aspects the Sun o Possibly during Saturn Dasa/Antardasa, a Badhaka lord influencing the father’s karaka (Sun) Revised Summary for Age Activation: Age 40 → 4th house activation (BCP); ruled by Saturn, who aspects Sun (father) Saturn’s role as Badhaka and Karmic enforcer causes the father’s death during this year. (No 11th house activation directly per BCP — the earlier reference was contextual.)",Libra,Surya

It is said that he will have an unsettled life, moving from place to place, without much comfort. Explanation: 1. Father Will Live Alone (தந்தை ஏகம்): • Sun placed alone without any planetary support in Aquarius suggests detachment and lack of bonding. • Mars, although related to family (2nd lord), also rules the 7th house (Maraka sthana) and aspects the Sun harshly. • Saturn, lord of Sukha and Panchama, typically indicates restrained domestic comfort, especially when he aspects the Sun from a dry, duty-bound standpoint. Fully Explainable – Sun alone and afflicted by Mars and Saturn directly suggests a solitary life for the father. 2. Father Will Live an Unsettled Life (அலைந்து ஜீவிப்பான்), Without Much Comfort (சுகமில்லை): • Saturn’s aspect (as 4th lord) on the Sun disrupts domestic happiness, home stability, and comfort. • Mars’s aspect causes restlessness, physical displacement, and indicates a career or lifestyle involving travel, relocation, or lack of anchoring. • This forms a clear ""Parivrajaka Yoga"" or wandering life karma when applied to the father’s circumstances. Fully Explainable – Mars and Saturn both influence the Sun, causing wandering and a lack of settled domestic comfort. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • The 5th house (Aquarius) activates between 30–36 years in BCP. • This is the most likely time the father's unsettled life becomes obvious to the native. • If the native experiences Saturn or Mars Dasa during this time, the effects will be especially prominent. Verse 24 Conclusion • Father Will Live Alone: Fully Explainable – Strongly supported by Sun’s isolation and hostile aspects. • Unsettled, Wandering Life Without Comfort: Fully Explainable – Classic result of Saturn-Mars aspect on unaided Sun. • Age Activation Point: 30–36 years; Dasa of Saturn or Mars may trigger visible outcomes related to the father's unsettled lifestyle.",Libra,Surya

After the birth of the native, there will be a separation within the family. It is said that comfort will be lacking, but there will be a certain divine alignment (Samayoga). Explanation: 1. Father's Lineage Will Consist of Four males (தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆண் நாலு): • Venus, a natural benefic and karaka for prosperity and reproduction, is conjoined with the Sun. • Though Venus is the 8th lord, her conjunction with the Sun in the 5th house (Putra Bhava) supports continuity of lineage, especially male progeny. • Despite being the 8th lord, Venus is also the Lagna lord, and hence her influence is not entirely malefic in this context. • The 5th house signifies children; Sun–Venus’s conjunction here indicates a karmically linked but fruitful lineage, though strained. Partially Explainable – Planetary combination shows family expansion, but the exact number “four males” is a Nadi Siddha outcome, likely derived from Nakshatra Padas or subtle chart triggers. 2. Separation Within the Family After Native’s Birth (ஜாதகன் ஜெனனத்திற்குப்பின் பாகம் பிரிவினை): • Venus, as the 8th lord, symbolizes hidden disruptions, secrets, and karmic breaks. • When conjoined with the Sun (father), it reflects a post-natal change in family harmony—often a division of family, assets, or residence. • This is also consistent with Nadi rules that associate 8th house combinations with “bhaga bedham” (division or separation) after a key life event (here, the native’s birth). Fully Explainable – Venus as 8th lord with Sun in 5th shows karmic separation in family soon after birth. 3. Lack of Comfort but Divine Alignment (சுகமில்லை, சமயோகம் உண்டு): • Venus, despite being the Lagna lord, is also the 8th lord here, causing paradoxical results. o Material comfort is denied due to the 8th lordship. o But the presence of Venus as Lagna lord and karaka of refinement and grace, and her placement in the 5th house (spiritual merit), results in divine grace or “Sama yoga”. • Sun–Venus in Aquarius (a sign of social cause, detachment, and philosophy) implies the father may suffer material discomfort but be inwardly aligned with a higher purpose or spiritual maturity. Fully Explainable – Lack of comfort from the 8th influence, with spiritual elevation due to Venus in the 5th house. 4. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • 5th house (Aquarius) activates between 30–36 years in BCP. • The family separation likely becomes evident soon after the native’s birth, but spiritual effects or karmic realizations may be felt more during this age band. • Events may manifest during Venus Dasa (being both Lagna and 8th lord) or Sun Dasa. Conclusion for Verse 25 • Father’s Lineage: Four males: Partially Explainable – Supported by planetary placement, but the exact number comes from Nadi calculations. • Family Separation After Native’s Birth: Fully Explainable – Venus as 8th lord with Sun in 5th causes karmic rupture. • Father Will Lack Comfort but Be Divinely Aligned: Fully Explainable – 8th house affliction and Venus’s grace both operate here. • Age Activation Point: Separation visible from birth; spiritual shift or karma ripens during age 30–36 or Venus/Sun Dasa.

Libra-26,ஆறாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் உச்ச நீசருடன் கூடியிருந்தால் ஜாதகனுக்கு ஏழு வயதில் பிதா மரணம் ஜாதகன் அற்ப சுகம் சொற்ப வித்தையுள்ளவனென்பர்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed in the sixth house along with exalted and debilitated planets (Venus and Mercury), then the father will pass away when the native is seven years old. It is said that the native will experience minimal comforts in life and possess limited knowledge. Explanation: 1. Father Dies When Native is 7 Years Old (ஜாதகனுக்கு ஏழு வயதில் பிதா மரணம்): • Sun (karaka for father) placed in the 6th house (Roga, Rina, Shatru sthana) is inherently a hostile placement, especially for the father’s well-being. • The 6th house, though a Trik house, often results in physical or karmic harm to the significator placed there. • Mercury, the 12th lord (Vyaya – loss), is debilitated and conjoined with the Sun → indicating loss and karmic exhaustion related to the father. • Venus, even though exalted, is the 8th lord (Ashtama) in addition to being the Lagna lord. Its placement with the Sun in the 6th house enhances karmic closure and early endings. • In Eswara Nadi, the combination of exalted + debilitated planets with Sun in the 6th often forms a powerful early Maraka configuration, especially for the father. Why Age 7? • Age 7 corresponds to the 7th house activation (BCP), but more significantly, it is in the danger zone for early Maraka periods in Nadi. • In many Nadi verses, ages 6–9 are known for Pitru Marana when the Sun is afflicted in the 6th or 8th houses, especially with Mercury (12th lord) and Venus (8th lord). Partially Explainable – Strong death indicators exist, but the exact age “7” is likely a Band of Years/Nakshatra-based Nadi outcome. 2. Native Will Have Minimal Comfort (அற்ப சுகம்): • The Lagna lord Venus, although exalted, is placed in the 6th house—a house of discomfort, enemies, and service. • This position suggests that while the native may possess grace or refinement (Venus exalted), it is trapped in a house of toil, leading to a lack of sustained comfort or luxury. • Mercury’s debilitation adds to mental or environmental instability, compounding discomfort. Fully Explainable – Exalted Venus in the 6th house and Mercury’s debilitation confirm a lack of sustained comfort. 3. Native Will Possess Limited Knowledge (சொற்ப வித்தை): • Mercury, the karaka for learning, speech, and intellect, is debilitated and conjoined with the Sun in Pisces. • This results in distorted or underdeveloped knowledge or limited formal education. • From a classical perspective, Mercury debilitated with the 6th house influence leads to: o Learning difficulties o Interrupted education o Lack of deep skill refinement Fully Explainable – Mercury’s debilitation in the 6th house fully explains the knowledge limitation. 4. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 7 is explicitly mentioned—likely derived from Band of Years logic. • 6th house (Pisces) becomes sensitive at age 30–36, but the early death of father is preset, likely due to Mercury’s debilitation and Venus–Sun conjunction active from birth. • Dasa of Mercury or Venus running during the age of 6–7 could trigger the Maraka event. Conclusion for Verse 26 • Father Dies at Age 7: Partially Explainable – Strong Maraka yoga exists, exact age is likely from the Nadi Band of Years. • Minimal Comfort in Life: Fully Explainable – Venus exalted but in 6th confirms suppressed comfort. • Limited Knowledge: Fully Explainable – Mercury debilitated in the 6th causes weak intellect or education. • Age Activation Point: Age 7 (explicit); Dasa of Mercury or Venus likely; heavy affliction from 6th house positions.",Libra,Surya
Libra-27,"ஆறாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் பாக்கிய, விரையாதிபதியான நீச்ச புதனுடன் கூடி பிதுர் ஸ்தானத்தை ஒருவரும் பாராதிருந்தால் தந்தையுடன் ஆண் மூன்று மேன்மையில்லை தந்தை சமயோக முள்ளவனென்பர்.","For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed in the sixth house along with the debilitated Mercury (Budhan), who is the lord of the ninth house (Bhagya) and twelfth house (Viraya), and if the ancestral house (Pitru Sthana) remains unaspected by any planet, then the father will have three males, but there will be no prominence or success in their lineage. It is said that the father will possess a spiritual inclination (Sama yoga). Explanation: 1. Father Has Three males (தந்தையுடன் ஆண் மூன்று): • Mercury’s debilitation (loss of balance) as Bhagya and Vyaya lord along with the Sun, in the 6th house, suggests a complicated karmic lineage. • Despite Mercury’s weakened state, his natural multiplicity and connection to the 9th house of Dharma and lineage still give rise to children, particularly males, through the Sun–Mercury pairing. • Nadi logic frequently links Mercury’s multiplicative quality (especially in dual signs like Gemini, Virgo, or Pisces) to male progeny count. Partially Explainable – Planetary placement indicates multiple males, but the precise number “three” is based on hidden Nadi principles (Nakshatra Padas or Band of Years). 2. No Prominence or Success in Father’s Lineage (மேன்மையில்லை): • Mercury, as the 9th lord (Bhagya), is debilitated and conjoined with the Sun in the 6th house, a dusthana. • The 6th house represents conflict, disease, service, and struggles, not conducive to fame or prosperity. • No planetary aspect on the 9th house (Gemini) indicates the absence of support, blessings, or grace upon the Pitru Sthana, leading to obscurity or lack of distinction in the father’s lineage. Fully Explainable – Debilitated 9th lord + unconnected 9th house (no drishti) = no lineage prominence. 3. Father Has Spiritual Inclination (Samayoga – சமயோகம்): • Mercury, though debilitated, is the 12th lord (Vyaya, Moksha, renunciation). • The Sun, when placed in the 6th, gains Upachaya strength, and combined with the 12th lord, can indicate spiritual or ascetic tendencies. • The absence of worldly recognition (no 9th house aspect) and the presence of karmic struggle contribute to an inward-turning disposition or spiritual alignment. Fully Explainable – Sun-12th lord Mercury conjunction in 6th reflects detachment, spiritual karma. 4. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • The 6th house (Pisces) activates around 30–36 years in BCP. • However, since the lack of recognition is life-long, this is more about karmic inheritance, felt subtly from the native’s early adulthood. • The father’s Samayoga/spirituality may become evident to the native during a Mercury or Sun Dasa, or 12th house activations. Conclusion for Verse 27 • Three males in the Father’s Lineage: Partially Explainable – Mercury supports multiplicity, but the number “three” comes from Nadi Siddha secrets. • No Prominence in Lineage: Fully Explainable – Debilitated 9th lord and unconnected 9th house explain this outcome. • Father Has Spiritual Alignment (Samayoga): Fully Explainable – Mercury as 12th lord with Sun in 6th reflects spiritual orientation. • Age Activation Point: Father’s karma and spiritual bend manifest around 30–36 years or Mercury/Sun Dasa.",Libra,Surya
Libra-28,ஆறாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் திருதிய ரோகாதிபதியுடன் கூடி பிதுர் ஸ்தானமேறிய சுக பஞ்சமாதிபதியால் நோக்கப்பட்டிருந்தால் தந்தை ஓராண்டிற்குள் அரிட்டமாவனென்பர்,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed in the sixth house along with the lords of the third house (Tritiya-Jupiter) and sixth house (Rogadhipathi-Jupiter ), and if the ancestral house (Pitru Sthana) is occupied by the lords of the fourth house (Sukha-Saturn) and fifth house (Panchama-Saturn), then it is said that the father will face an untimely demise within a year. Explanation: 1. Father Will Die Within One Year of Native’s Birth (தந்தை ஓராண்டிற்குள் அரிட்டமாவன்): • Sun, karaka for father, placed in the 6th house, a dusthana, is already highly vulnerable. • Sun is conjoined with Jupiter, who, though a natural benefic, acts as a malefic functional lord (3rd and 6th lord)—especially 6th lord Jupiter conjoined with Sun causes disease, karmic exhaustion, and rapid health decline for the father. • The 9th house, representing the father, is occupied by Saturn, a karmic planet and natural killer (Ayush karaka). o Though Saturn is a Yoga Karaka for Libra Lagna, its placement in the 9th as lord of Sukha and Putra sthana shows that the karma connected with the father is heavy and has ripened. • The combination indicates that the father’s prarabdha karma is completed shortly after the native’s birth. Why “within a year”? • This precision comes from Nadi Band of Years logic: o When Sun + 6th lord are in a dusthana, and o The 9th house is afflicted or karmically loaded, o It often points to father’s death within the first year of birth. • This configuration directly activates the “Early Pitru Marana” zone in Nadi astrology. Fully Explainable with Nadi Support – The planetary structure confirms early and unavoidable death due to karmic overload. 2. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • The father’s death occurs within one year of the native’s birth—this is a pre-set karmic condition, not dependent on house activation per BCP. • In Nadi, such events are locked into the first year if: o Sun is in 6th/8th, and o 6th lord or Maraka joins or aspects, and o Pitru Sthana is afflicted by karmic lords (e.g., Saturn) Conclusion for Verse 28 • Father Will Die Within One Year of Birth: Fully Explainable – Based on strong 6th house affliction and karmic load on Pitru Sthana. • Age Activation Point: Within 1 year of the native’s birth; predetermined by planetary placements and Nadi Band of Years logic.",Libra,Surya
Libra-29,ஆறாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் நீச்சனுடன் கூடி பிதுர் ஸ்தானத்தில் இரண்டு மூன்று ஆறு ஏழு இந்த வீட்டுக்குடையவர்கள் கூடியிருந்தால் ஆண் மூன்று பெண்ணதிகம் பிதுர்கள் தனித்தனி பிரிந்திருப்பரென்பர்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed in the sixth house along with a debilitated planet (Mercury), and if the ancestral house (Pitru Sthana) is influenced by planets ruling the second, third, sixth, and seventh houses (Mars and Jupiter), then the father's lineage will consist of three males, with more females in the family. It is said that the ancestors will live separately, apart from one another. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage – Three males, More females (ஆண் மூன்று, பெண் அதிகம்): • Mercury, though debilitated, is still a karaka for multiplication, especially when conjoined with the Sun. • The 6th house placement shows karmic burden, but not necessarily destruction of lineage—rather, it reflects uneven prosperity. • The 9th house (Gemini) is being influenced by: o Mars (fiery, masculine) → supports male children. o Jupiter (expansive, progeny karaka) → gives both males and females. o But when both are present or aspect without benefic moderation, females may outnumber males due to Jupiter’s neutral gender preference and Mars’ inability to sustain lineage in Gemini (Mercury’s sign). Partially Explainable – Multiple influences point to a large family with male and female members, but the exact numbers (“three males, more females”) are drawn from Nadi Nakshatra-based logic. 2. Ancestors Will Live Separately (தனித்தனி பிரிந்திருப்பர்): • Mercury as 12th lord (separation) and debilitated, sitting with Sun in the 6th house (runa-shatru sthana), shows inherited family disunity. • Jupiter and Mars, while signifying progeny, are both natural aggressors and separating influences when not checked by benefics like the Moon or Venus. • Their involvement in the 9th house (father’s house) without benefic intervention implies that descendants may live scattered or disunited—either physically separated or emotionally disconnected. Fully Explainable – Strong karmic indications through 6th and 12th links and Mars-Jupiter aggression result in lineage separation. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Although no specific age is given, effects of lineage disunity and karmic fragmentation are typically experienced around: o 30–36 years (6th house activation) o During Mercury or Sun Dasa, or 12th lord periods • Family separation may also be an inherited condition that reflects passively throughout life rather than as a single event. Conclusion for Verse 29 • Three males and More females in Lineage: 🔶 Partially Explainable – Supported by multiplicity-inducing planets, exact count derived from Nadi secrets. • Ancestors Live Separately: Fully Explainable – 6th and 12th house involvement, Mars–Jupiter aspects clearly indicate separation. • Age Activation Point: 30–36 years; also manifests passively due to inherited karma; Mercury/Sun Dasa may make it visible.",Libra,Surya
Libra-30,ஆறாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் சுக பஞ்சமாதிபன் கூடி இருந்தால் பிதுர் வர்க்கம் க்ஷீணமடையும். ஜாதகனுக்கு பத்து வயதிற்குள் பிதா மரணமாவனென்பர்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed in the sixth house along with the lords of the fourth house (Sukha) and fifth house (Panchama)-Saturn, then the father's lineage will weaken over time. It is said that the father will pass away before the native reaches the age of ten. Explanation: 1. Father's Lineage Will Weaken Over Time (பிதுர் வர்க்கம் க்ஷீணமடையும்): • Sun in the 6th house signifies conflict, disease, and karmic debt, and brings adversity to the father. • Saturn, despite being a Yoga Karaka for Libra Lagna, when placed in a dusthana (6th house) and conjoined with Sun, forms a Pitrudosha-type configuration. • Saturn, being both Sukha and Putra Karaka, when afflicted, affects family continuity and happiness, implying: o Gradual diminishing of the father’s lineage (fewer descendants or scattered family) o Loss of strength, unity, or prosperity in the ancestral line Fully Explainable – Sun in 6th with Saturn as family-signifying lords directly shows lineage deterioration over time. 2. Father Will Die Before Age 10 (ஜாதகனுக்கு பத்து வயதிற்குள் பிதா மரணம்): • This is a strong early death indication, and the configuration supports it clearly: o Sun in the 6th house = danger to father o Saturn, a natural Ayush karaka, conjoined with Sun in the 6th = karmic cutoff • Saturn in the 6th does not always protect, especially in early years—it enforces karmic results tied to ancestral debts. • The affliction from a dusthana combined with the absence of a benefic aspect (e.g., Jupiter or Venus) confirms that the father is unlikely to survive past the native's early years. Why age 10? • This falls within the “early Maraka window” (ages 6–12) used in Nadi astrology. • The 5th house Band of Years ends by age 12; 6th house karma activates from 30+, but Maraka events due to planetary placement can be preset at birth, as seen here. Partially Explainable – Death-indicating combination is clear, but exact age ""before 10"" is from Nadi Band of Years precision. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Father’s death before age 10 → Event occurs outside BCP-based activation, but is triggered by natal placement + Nadi Band of Years • Sun–Saturn in 6th = karmic load culminates quickly, causing early Marana • The Dasa of Saturn or Sun in the early years can trigger the actual death event. Conclusion for Verse 30 • Father’s Lineage Will Weaken: Fully Explainable – Saturn with Sun in 6th undermines ancestral strength. • Father Dies Before Age 10: Partially Explainable – Indicated by placement, exact age from Nadi Band of Years. • Age Activation Point: Before age 10; preset karmic result from natal 6th house placement with Maraka alignment (Saturn–Sun).

Explanation: 1. Father’s Karmic Journey Ends at Age 32 (முப்பத்திரண்டு வயதில் பிதுர் கர்மம்): • The Sun is exalted in Aries (7th house) but is placed with Venus and Mercury, both of whom carry hidden karmic burdens: o Venus – Though Lagna lord, is also the 8th lord, bringing sudden, fated events (such as death or deep transformation). o Mercury – As 12th lord (Vyaya) and 9th lord (father’s house), indicates loss or closure related to the father. • The Sun, though exalted, is not unafflicted – it’s surrounded by two karma-heavy lords. The key timing clue is that: • The native is born in the Dasa of Sun, the 11th lord (Labhadhipathi). • According to Nadi Band of Years logic, age 32 activates: o The 8th house (Taurus) from Libra Lagna (Maraka sthana for the father) o Or a karmic completion point linked to the Sun–Venus–Mercury combination. Thus, even though the Sun is exalted, its combination with Maraka/Vyaya/Bhagya lords brings karmic culmination, leading to the father’s death at age 32. Partially Explainable – Strong planetary logic for karmic closure exists; exact age “32” is likely derived from Nadi Band of Years and Dasa-Pada techniques. 2. Exalted Sun with Karma Lords – Why Not Protection? • Although exalted planets are generally strong, when the Sun joins the 8th and 12th lords, even exaltation cannot shield them from: o Fated endings. o Inherited karma (from ancestors or lineage) • 7th house for Libra Lagna is Maraka Sthana, and placement of Sun here, even exalted, brings the risk of death to the father if other conditions are met. Fully Explainable – Maraka sthana + Karma lord conjunction overpowers the exaltation. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 32 aligns with activation of the 8th house (Taurus) in BCP. • Combined with Sun Dasa at birth, the native’s life is tightly tied to the father’s karmic end in the year 32. Conclusion for Verse 31 • Father’s Karma Ends at Age 32: Partially Explainable – Supported by Maraka Sthana placement and Karma lord conjunction, age from Nadi timing. • Exalted Sun Not Protective: Fully Explainable – 7th is Maraka; joined by 8th and 12th lords cancels protective effect. • Age Activation Point: Age 32; Activation of 8th house (Taurus), closure during Sun Dasa or its Bhukti.",Libra,Surya
Libra-32,ஏழாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் ஏகனாய் உச்சம் பெற்று லக்கின கேந்திர மேறிய சுக பஞ்சம கர்மாதிபதிகளின் திருஷ்டியடைந்திருந்தால் பிதா இருவர். அதில் ஜேஷ்டனுக்குத் தாரமிரண்டென்பர்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed alone in the seventh house, attaining exaltation, and if it is aspected by the lords of the fourth house (Sukha), fifth house (Panchama)-Saturn, and tenth house (Karma-Moon) which are positioned in the Lagna Kendra, then the father’s lineage will consist of two fathers (possibly indicating two paternal figures). It is said that the elder among them will have two marriages. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage Includes Two Paternal Figures (பிதா இருவர்): • This could mean: o The native has two paternal figures (biological father + stepfather or guardian), or o The father is one of two siblings, hence two male figures continuing the paternal lineage. Supporting logic: • Sun exalted in the 7th house (a Maraka sthana) gives a strong but karmically intense paternal presence. • Aspects from Saturn (lord of Putra and Sukha) and Moon (Karmaadhipathi) indicate: o A duality in fatherhood roles, or o Father's life is shared or divided karmically, such as in adoption, separation, remarriage, etc. In Nadi astrology, “two fathers” often implies: • A primary father and a guardian (e.g., grandfather, uncle who raised the child) • Or in lineage terms, the native’s paternal line descends through two major branches (e.g., elder and younger sibling lines) Partially Explainable – Planetary setup suggests karmic split or duality in paternal lineage, but the idea of “two fathers” is a classic Nadi idiom requiring contextual interpretation. 2. Elder Among Them Will Have Two Marriages (ஜேஷ்டனுக்குத் தாரமிரண்டு): • From the father's perspective (9th house Gemini as Lagna), the 11th house (Aries) represents elder siblings or paternal uncles. • The Sun exalted in Aries, with no afflictions, gives strength to this elder figure. • The 7th house from Aries (Libra) may contain or be influenced by Venus (not mentioned here), or more importantly, Saturn and Moon aspects may fall on it: o Saturn’s aspect on the 7th house (from Aries) → delays and multiples marriage o Moon, as a fluctuating graha, may contribute to changing relationships. Hence, the elder among the paternal line is said to have two spouses, consistent with Nadi's predictive phrasing. Fully Explainable – Saturn’s aspect + Nadi logic around Moon = multiple marriages for an elder male. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • No specific age is given, but: o The 7th house (Aries) is active during 36–42 years (BCP) o Events related to marriage, paternal karma, or relationship karmas may occur during this period. o Dasa of Saturn or Moon can activate the paternal split or relationship events in the native's life. Conclusion for Verse 32 • Two Fathers or Paternal Figures: Partially Explainable – Implied duality in paternal karma, matching Nadi idiom; contextual. • Elder Has Two Marriages: Fully Explainable – Exalted Sun with Saturn and Moon aspects justifies multiple marriages in the elder’s karma. • Age Activation Point: Likely between 36–42 years; Saturn or Moon Dasa may trigger visible effects.",Libra,Surya

Explanation: 1. Father’s Karma Concludes at Age 30 (முப்பது வயதில் தந்தைக்குக் கர்மம்): • The Sun–Mars conjunction in the 7th house indicates a powerful but volatile placement—Sun is exalted, and Mars is its sign lord, making both planets strong yet aggressive and karmically intense. • The 7th house is the Maraka sthana for Libra Lagna; both karaka (Sun) and Maraka (Mars) being present suggests a critical karmic convergence for the father. • Jupiter, as the 6th lord (disease, conflict, karmic pressure) and 3rd lord (siblings, efforts), aspects the 7th house from the 11th: o The 11th house (Leo) is also the Badhakasthana for Libra Lagna, intensifying karmic challenges when its occupant is the Rogadhipathi (Jupiter). Why age 30? • Age 30 marks the end of the 5th house Band of Years and the beginning of the 6th house karmas (Pisces). • Jupiter’s aspect from Badhaka sthana on the Maraka sthana (7th house), where both Sun and Mars are placed, creates a perfect Nadi trigger for the father’s death at 30. Partially Explainable – Planetary forces indicate Maraka and Badhaka karma, but the precise age “30” is drawn from the Nadi Band of Years or Pada-based timing. 2. Why Jupiter's Aspect Is Fatal in This Case: • Jupiter is typically a benefic, but for Libra Lagna, it is: o 3rd lord (Upachaya) – neutral o 6th lord – functional malefic • Its placement in Leo (11th house – Badhaka) and aspect on a Sun–Mars exalted combination in Maraka sthana amplifies conflict, karmic completion, and disease-related departure. Fully Explainable – All houses involved (3, 6, 7, 11) support the karmic culmination scenario. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 30 corresponds with: o End of 5th house cycle (Band of Years) o Beginning of 6th house (Pisces) – often fatal for father if Sun is afflicted or placed in 6th/7th. • Likely Sun or Jupiter Dasa/Antardasa at this time triggers the event. Conclusion for Verse 33 • Father’s Karma Ends at Age 30: Partially Explainable – Strong Maraka + Badhaka involvement; exact timing from Nadi Band of Years. • Jupiter’s Aspect from 11th Triggers the Event: Fully Explainable – 6th lord in Badhaka house influencing Maraka sthana. • Age Activation Point: 30 years; triggered by 6th house cycle onset and Sun/Jupiter Dasa influence.",Libra,Surya

It is said that the father's lineage will experience poverty. Explanation: 1. Father's Lineage Will Consist of Four males and One female (தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆண் நான்கு, பெண் ஒன்று): • The Sun–Mercury combination in the 7th house (Maraka Sthana) gives the ancestral line some strength, but with karmic baggage (due to Mercury’s 12th lordship). • Jupiter, the karaka for children, placed in the 9th house (Pitru Sthana), indicates preservation of dharma and family lineage. • However, Jupiter being aspected by Mars, the 2nd lord (family) and 7th lord (Maraka), brings strain and contraction in lineage despite the potential. • Mars’s 7th aspect is direct and aggressive—it adds malefic pressure, allowing only partial fruition: hence, 4 males and 1 female. Partially Explainable – Jupiter’s presence supports multiple children; Mars's aspect restricts it; exact numbers from Nadi Nakshatra/Amsa logic. 2. Father’s Lineage Will Experience Poverty (தந்தை வர்க்கம் வறுமையடைவது): • Jupiter, though naturally benefic, when aspected by Mars (2nd lord) in a harsh angle, indicates: o Loss of wealth o Erosion of family prosperity • Mercury, as the 12th lord (Vyaya), conjoined with the Sun in Maraka sthana, reflects ongoing karmic expenditure from the father’s side. • The Sun’s exaltation does not prevent this, as the combination of Mercury (Vyaya) and Mars’s aspect on Jupiter overrides the protective grace. Fully Explainable – Mars’s malefic aspect on Jupiter in 9th + Mercury’s 12th lordship = karmic poverty for the father’s lineage. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • While no age is mentioned, we can infer: o 9th house (Gemini) activates between 48–54 years (BCP) o The poverty condition is inherited and could reflect across life, not just at a specific age. o Manifestation likely during Mercury or Mars Dasa, or when the 9th house Band of Years is active. Conclusion for Verse 34 • Four males and One female in Father's Lineage: Partially Explainable – Jupiter supports progeny, but the exact count from Nadi Padas. • Father’s Lineage Will Experience Poverty: Fully Explainable – Mars’s aggressive aspect on Jupiter + Mercury’s 12th lordship confirms karmic loss. • Age Activation Point: No specific age; effects seen during Mercury/Mars Dasa or 9th house activation (48–54 years).",Libra,Surya

Explanation: 1. Father Will Face Misfortune Immediately After Native’s Birth (ஜாதகன் ஜெனித்ததும் தந்தைக்கு அரிட்டம்): • This is a classic Nadi Yogam indicating instantaneous karma activation at birth. • The Sun in Maraka sthana (7th) being joined by multiple house lords creates: o Overloaded karmic pressure focused on the paternal line. o The presence of 6th lord Jupiter, 8th lord Venus, and Saturn amplifies doshas relating to health, suffering, and inherited debt. • Mercury, the 9th lord (Bhagya), being debilitated, confirms loss of paternal grace or support. • The combination of multiple lords from dusthana (6, 8), Sukha, and lagna bhavas, all merging in the 7th, shows a karmic blockade that hits the father as soon as the native is born. This is akin to: • Pitra Dosha, or • Karma Moksha Yogam for the father, completed through the birth of the native. Fully Explainable – Classic Nadi configuration for inherited karma hitting the father instantly; Mercury’s debility removes divine protection. Why Pitra Dosha was mentioned: • Pitra Dosha is typically indicated when: o Sun (Pitru Karaka) is badly afflicted. o The Sun is placed with multiple malefics or functionally adverse lords. o There is the weakness of the 9th house (house of father, dharma, blessings). o There is an early death or suffering of the father related to the native’s karmic birth. In this verse: • Sun is heavily afflicted: o Conjoined with multiple lords, many of them malefic for Libra Lagna. o 6th lord (Jupiter) → disease, obstacles. o 8th lord (Venus) → death/transformation. o Saturn as 4L/5L → delays and karmic burden. o Mercury (9L) debilitated → no protection to father from dharma. • Father dies immediately after birth → classic signature of a karmic debt being repaid or triggered through the native’s birth → Pitra Dosha logic applies. Conclusion: The mention of Pitra Dosha is justified here — this is a classic example where the native’s birth triggers early death of the father due to accumulated karma. Why Karma Moksha Yogam was mentioned: • Karma Moksha Yogam for father implies: o The father's pending karma gets released through the circumstances of the native's birth. o The father is released from this karma by undergoing death or suffering at a karmically destined moment linked to the native's incarnation. In this verse: • The combination of Sun with 6L, 8L, multiple Kendra and Trik lords is not just a Pitra Dosha signature — it is also a release combination. • 9L debilitated → indicates that the father’s dharma path is ending or is no longer supported in this life. • The father dies exactly at the moment of the native’s birth — this is a strong indicator that the father’s karmic account was to be settled through this process → a form of Karma Moksha. • In Nadi readings, when such immediate death of a father happens upon a native’s birth, it is typically read as a Moksha indicator — the father’s karma is cleared through this painful but releasing event. Conclusion: The mention of Karma Moksha Yogam for the father is also appropriate in this case. Final View: Pitra Dosha mention is justified → strong Sun affliction + 9L weakness + father’s suffering. Karma Moksha Yogam mention is justified → the death of the father linked to the native’s birth is a karmic closure pattern. 2. Why So Many House Lords in the 7th House Triggers Misfortune: • The 7th house (Maraka sthana) can act as a focal point for karma discharge, especially for Libra Lagna. • When Sun, joined by Saturn (Sukha), Jupiter (Roga), and Venus (Lagna + Ashtama), all converge, the father's life force is squeezed. • Additionally: o Mercury’s debility → no “Bhagya Bala” o No benefic aspect on Sun/Mercury → karma becomes unshielded. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • The event happens at birth (""ஜெனித்ததும்""), so there’s no need for BCP timing. • It is prarabdha karma for the father, triggered by the native’s entry into life. Conclusion for Verse 35 • Father Faces Misfortune at Birth of Native: Fully Explainable – Multiple dusthana-linked lords with Sun in Maraka + debilitated 9th lord Mercury confirm this. • Karmic Convergence of House Lords in 7th House:  Fully Explainable – Overloaded Maraka sthana with Sun leads to rapid karma discharge. • Age Activation Point: At birth, preset prarabdha karma is triggered by the native’s arrival. Libra Lagna-Sun in 8th house-Taurus எட்டாமிடம்",Libra,Surya
Libra-36,"எட்டாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் பாக்கிய விரையாதிபதியுடன் கூடி இரண்டிலிருக்கும் சுக, பஞ்சமாதிபதியால் நோக்கப் பட்டால் தந்தையுடன் ஆண் மூன்று, ஜாதகன் சமயோகமுள்ளனென்பர்.","For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed in the eighth house along with the lords of the ninth house (Bhagya) and twelfth house (Viraya)-Mercury, and if it is aspected by the lords of the fourth house (Sukha), and fifth house (Panchama)-Saturn, then the father’s lineage will have three males. It is said that the native will possess a strong spiritual alignment (Samayoga). The placement of the Pitru Karaka Sun in the 8th house, combined with the aspect of Saturn (4th and 5th lord), creates a strong Tapasvi Yoga tendency, indicating karmic austerity and spiritual striving linked to both the native and the ancestral line. The Sun’s 8th house placement under Saturn’s influence also suggests a Moksha Yoga pattern, where karmic debts of the father’s lineage are being dissolved, leading to spiritual alignment (Samayoga) for the native and the gradual release of ancestral karmic burdens. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage Includes Three males (தந்தையுடன் ஆண் மூன்று): • Sun + Mercury in the 8th house typically shows a karmic burdened but continuous paternal line. • Mercury, despite being the 12th lord, also rules the 9th house (father)—its presence with the Sun reinforces a connection to the father’s lineage, albeit with karmic debt. • Saturn, lord of Putra sthana (5th) and Sukha sthana (4th), aspects the Sun and Mercury combination from the 2nd house (family, lineage): o Saturn’s dry yet dharmic nature ensures that the lineage continues in a restricted but structured manner. o Three males are likely based on: • Saturn's numerical linkage (often denoting conservative male progeny) • Mercury’s duplicity + Saturn’s stabilizing nature = limited yet confirmed male descent Partially Explainable – Planetary logic supports continued lineage with males, but the exact number “three” is derived from Nadi principles (Nakshatra Pada influence). 2. Native Will Possess Samayoga – Strong Spiritual Alignment (சமயோகமுள்ளன்): • Sun in the 8th house is a powerful Tapaswi Yoga indicator, especially when: o Joined by Mercury (9th and 12th lord) – connecting Dharma and Moksha o Aspected by Saturn – the karaka for discipline, detachment, karmic realization • This exact planetary structure shows: o Withdrawal from materialism o Detachment from household bonds o A strong inner alignment with karmic, mystical, or spiritual practices Fully Explainable – Classic spiritual yogas present: 8th house Sun + Mercury (Bhagya/Viraya) + Saturn's aspect = Samayoga. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • 8th house (Taurus) activates during 42–48 years (BCP) • Spiritual maturity or a significant turning point likely during: o Saturn Dasa (as the aspecting graha) or o Mercury Dasa (as 9th/12th lord, conjoined Sun) Conclusion for Verse 36 • Father’s Lineage Has Three males: Partially Explainable – Supported by Saturn’s 5th lordship and Mercury’s role, but the exact number from Nadi Siddha logic. • Native Has Samayoga (Spiritual Inclination): Fully Explainable – Sun in 8th with Bhagya/Viraya lord and Saturn’s aspect confirms strong spiritual karma. • Age Activation Point: 42–48 years; spiritual fruit likely during Saturn or Mercury Dasa. Notes on ""சமயோகம்"" (Samayogam) The term ""சமயோகம்"" (Samayogam) in Nadi astrology and classical Tamil usage carries layered meanings, and the correct interpretation depends heavily on context. Let’s break it down: Literal & General Meaning: • ""Sama"" (சம) = Equal, balanced, peaceful, auspicious • ""Yogam"" (யோகம்) = Union, conjunction, fortune, destiny, or spiritual merit So, Samayogam translates to: ""A balanced or auspicious union/conjunction."" Common Interpretations in Tamil Astrology: Term Meaning in Context Usage in Nadi Samayoga Fortunate or auspicious combination Used to indicate divine blessings, supportive life circumstances, or a positive turn of karmic events. Sama Yogam (சம யோகம்) Occasionally interpreted as religious or spiritual alignment, especially when involving 9th, 12th, or 8th lords. Less frequent, but plausible in spiritual verses Samayogam uṇḍu (சமயோகம் உண்டு) “There is auspicious alignment” or “There is fortune.” A generic positive life marker or destiny-supportive indicator In Verse 36 Context: • Sun in 8th house • With 9th + 12th lord Mercury • Aspected by Saturn (Dharma-karaka, 5th lord) This does create Tapaswi and Moksha Yoga patterns, so the translation of Samayoga as ""spiritual alignment"" is highly appropriate and contextually accurate in this context. However, in verses without such a Moksha-related planetary setup, the same term Samayoga might mean: “Good fortune”, “auspicious connection”, or “favourable karma”. Final Verdict: • In Verse 36, your translation of Samayoga = ""spiritual alignment"" is correct and contextually justified. • In other verses, it may simply mean ""auspicious fortune"" or ""karmic support"", unless connected to 8th/9th/12th lords or Moksha houses. Note: What is Tapasvi Yoga? What is Moksha Yoga? How such patterns can arise in a chart, especially relevant to Verse 36? Tapasvi Yoga — Definition and Formation Tapasvi Yoga means Yoga of asceticism or ""Yoga of austerity and spiritual striving."" Classical Indicators: • It is formed when Saturn, Ketu, and Jupiter (all three or at least two of them) are conjoined or aspecting each other in important houses — especially Trikona (1,5,9) or Kendra (1,4,7,10). • Strong influence of Saturn + Ketu + Jupiter creates: o Renunciation tendencies o Spiritual austerity o Detachment from material life o Interest in higher knowledge, penance, and sadhana. In Nadi tradition: • Sun + Ketu + Saturn influence can also produce Tapasvi tendencies, especially when the 9th house or its lord is afflicted or involved. • Ketu in 9H or aspecting Sun → strong Vairagya and karmic detachment. • Jupiter adds spiritual wisdom → makes it a ""Tapasvi"" rather than a ""mere sufferer"". Purpose: • The soul is working through past karmic austerities. • The native (or linked ancestor) is destined for spiritual progress through hardship. Moksha Yoga — Definition and Formation Moksha Yoga means Yoga for Liberation — a pattern that gives ultimate release from rebirth or great spiritual evolution. Classical Indicators: • Strong connection of 12th house, Ketu, Moon, Saturn, and sometimes Venus (if Venus is spiritually inclined) → combined influence can create a detachment and liberation-seeking nature. • When the 4th lord, 8th lord, 12th lord, and Ketu form a relationship, especially involving Lagna, Sun, or Moon, this is very potent for Moksha Yoga. In Nadi tradition: • Sun + Ketu is one of the strongest Moksha triggers → it weakens ego (Sun) and increases spiritual seeking. • Ketu in 12th or 9th, or heavily aspecting 4H or Moon → release-oriented patterns. • When such patterns coincide with the early death of the father or ancestors, it often indicates that the ancestral karma is being concluded. → The father exits; spiritual line is purified → a form of Moksha Yoga working through family karma. Applying this to Verse 36 Let’s recall Verse 36: Sun + Mercury in 8H, aspected by 4L/5L Saturn. Father’s lineage: 3 males. Native has Samayoga → interpreted as spiritual alignment. How it applies: • Sun in 8H → one of the strongest placements for karmic dissolution (8H = house of transformation/death). • Sun + Mercury → intellectual detachment + weakening of ego. • Saturn’s aspect → ascetic influence → adds Tapasvi flavour (Saturn represents tapas, penance). • If Ketu were involved (not mentioned here, but if present or aspecting), the Moksha effect would be even stronger. Why Tapasvi Yoga is implied: • Sun in 8H under Saturn’s influence → austerity, karmic cleansing. • Mercury in 8H → learning of occult or spiritual knowledge. Why Moksha Yoga is implied: • Sun in 8H + aspect of Saturn → release-oriented karmic pattern. • In Nadi, when the Sun is strongly afflicted in 8H and the father’s line is reduced or disrupted, it often signals Moksha of the ancestral line or the personal soul.

Libra-37,எட்டாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் பாக்கிய விரையாதிபதியுடன் கூடி ஆறாமிடமேறிய சுக பஞ்சமாதிபதியால் நோக்கப்பட்டால் தந்தையுடன் ஆணிரண்டு. ஜாதகன் பிறந்த ஓராண்டில் பிதா மரணம்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed in the eighth house along with the lords of the ninth house (Bhagya) and twelfth house (Viraya)-Mercury, and if it is aspected by the lords of the fifth house (Panchama), fourth house (Sukha)-Saturn, then the father's lineage will include two males. It is said that the father will pass away within a year of the native's birth. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage Includes Two males (தந்தையுடன் ஆண் இரண்டு): • The Sun–Mercury combination in the 8th house denotes a heavily karmic paternal inheritance, with Mercury contributing multiplicative potential (limited here due to affliction). • Saturn, the 5th lord (Putra sthana), aspects this combination from the 6th house, which is malefic but also an upachaya (growth) house. • As Saturn is a slow-moving, constrictive graha, it limits the expansion of progeny, resulting in a small male lineage—hence, two males is both karmically plausible and astrologically restrained. Partially Explainable – Planetary logic restricts lineage to a few male members, but the exact number “two” comes from Nadi Pada-level interpretation. 2. Father Dies Within One Year of Native’s Birth (ஜாதகன் பிறந்த ஓராண்டில் பிதா மரணம்): • This is a clear-cut early Maraka yoga due to: o Sun (karaka for father) placed in the 8th house (Ayur sthana) → natural risk. o Conjunction with Mercury, the 12th lord (Vyaya, exit) → reinforces loss. o Aspect of Saturn from the 6th house adds disease, karma, and exhaustion—Saturn is the karaka for time and karma and accelerates the karmic discharge here. • The combination of Sun (8th), Mercury (12th lord), and Saturn’s 6th house aspect creates a fatal alignment in Nadi astrology, especially for the father. Why “within one year”? • In Nadi, a father's death soon after birth is linked with: o Sun in 6th, 8th, or 12th o Affliction by 6th, 8th, or 12th lords o Activation of such houses from birth (prarabdha karma) Fully Explainable – Strong fatal configuration for the early death of the father due to house placement, lords involved, and Saturn’s aspect. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • The event is predefined, occurring within the first year, i.e., not dependent on BCP progression. • Likely due to: o Mercury or Saturn Dasa at birth, or o Activation of 12th lord and 8th house karma by default Conclusion for Verse 37 • Father’s Lineage Includes Two males: Partially Explainable – Saturn’s influence restrains expansion; exact number from Nadi tradition. • Father Dies Within One Year of Native’s Birth: Fully Explainable – Sun in 8th with 12th lord Mercury and Saturn’s malefic aspect makes this inevitable. • Age Activation Point: Within one year from birth; pre-decided prarabdha karma activated by house and Dasa placements.",Libra,Surya
Libra-38,"எட்டாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் ஏகனாய் தனித்து இரண்டிலிருக்கும் சுக பஞ்சமாதிபதியால் நோக்கப் பட்டால் தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆண் நான்கு, பெண் நான்கு, பிதா நாலாண்டில் மரணமாவனென்பர்.","For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka) is placed alone in the eighth house and aspected by the lords of the fourth house (Sukha) and fifth house (Panchama)-Saturn positioned in the second house, then the father’s lineage will consist of four males and four females. It is said that the father will pass away within four years. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage Will Include Four males and Four females (தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆண் நான்கு, பெண் நான்கு): • Sun in the 8th house, while generally indicative of paternal karmic burden, does not necessarily prevent a large lineage if: o The aspecting planet is Saturn, lord of Putra sthana (5th) and Sukha sthana (4th). • Saturn placed in the 2nd house (lineage/family) and aspecting the Sun in the 8th gives structured family continuation, often with a balance of male and female offspring, especially in Nadi astrology. • The number 4 males and 4 females suggests a symmetrical karmic family layout, possibly influenced by: o Saturn's number (4, 8 as multiples) o Nakshatra Pada rules are followed in Nadi texts. Partially Explainable – Saturn’s role supports lineage expansion and balance; exact count comes from deeper Nadi-level rules. 2. Father Will Die Within Four Years of Native’s Birth (பிதா நாலாண்டில் மரணம்): • Sun alone in the 8th = highly vulnerable placement for father • Saturn, being both Sukha and Putra lord, though generally protective, is: o In the 2nd house, a Maraka sthana o Aspecting the 8th house, which accelerates karmic results. • This alignment in Nadi astrology creates a ""Time-locked Maraka"", where the father’s death is not immediate, but occurs within a few years (here, four years is specifically stated) Why 4 years? • Saturn’s connection to the number 4 is strong (Shani = fourth weekday, fourth number in sequence). • Sun in the 8th house afflicted only by Saturn (without Mercury or Jupiter's interference) often results in gradual decline, rather than instant death. • This aligns with Nadi observations where mid-term prarabdha karma manifests in the 3rd–5th years post birth. Fully Explainable – Placement and aspect form a gradual Maraka effect, manifesting clearly by age 4. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Father’s death occurs within 4 years of birth—i.e., preset karma, not BCP-driven. • This is not based on 8th house activation (which occurs much later), but due to: o Sun–Saturn tension o Saturn’s 7th aspect from Maraka sthana (2nd house) Conclusion for Verse 38 • Father’s Lineage: Four males and Four females: Partially Explainable – Balanced lineage supported by Saturn's aspect; exact count based on Nadi Padas. • Father Dies Within Four Years: Fully Explainable – Sun in 8th, aspected by Saturn from Maraka sthana ensures karmic death within 4 years. • Father dies during the Lagna Band of Years (before age 6), early maraka influence triggered by 8H Sun + Saturn aspect."" • Age Activation Point: Before age 4; determined by Saturn’s aspect and Nadi prarabdha triggers.",Libra,Surya
Libra-39,"எட்டாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் ஏகனாயிருந்து சனியால் பார்க்கப்பட்டு பிதுர் ஸ்தானத்தில் சுக்கிரன் கேது கூடியிருந்தால் தந்தை வர்க்கம் மூன்றில் தந்தை தீர்க்கம், பிதா பெண் கர்மஞ்செய்து பொருளடைவனென்பர்.","For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka) is placed alone in the eighth house and aspected by Saturn, and if the ancestral house (Pitru Sthana) contains Venus (Sukran) and Ketu, then the father’s lineage will consist of three members, with the father having longevity. It is said that the father will engage in actions related to women and accumulate wealth. Saturn is taken to be placed in the 2nd house, though not specified in the verse. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage Has Three Members, with the Father Having Longevity (தந்தை வர்க்கம் மூன்று, தீர்க்கம்): • Sun in 8th, though inherently a challenging placement, when aspected by Saturn, indicates: o A slow-moving karmic outcome, not a sudden or early death o Saturn’s aspect here is disciplining rather than destructive, often granting longevity due to the delay-inducing nature of Shani. • 9th house (Pitru Sthana) containing Venus and Ketu: o Venus brings lineage and continuity, though sensual in influence o Ketu can cut or isolate but also spiritualizes or limits the number of descendants. • So: o The presence of Ketu in the 9th reduces the number of paternal line members. o Venus maintains dharma and lineage, while Saturn’s aspect ensures gradual karmic unfolding, leading to longevity for the father. o ""மூன்றில் தந்தை தீர்க்கம்"" suggests 3 male members in the line, with the father being long-lived among them. Partially Explainable – Saturn’s aspect protects, Venus supports continuity, and Ketu limits; the number “three” is Nadi-specific. 2. Father Will Engage in Actions Related to Women and Accumulate Wealth (பிதா பெண் கர்மஞ் செய்து பொருளடைவன்): • This is seen from the 9th house (Gemini) having: o Venus – natural karaka for women, comforts, arts, luxury o Ketu – often spiritualizes or creates intense, unconventional connections. • When Venus is in Pitru Sthana, it often means: o The father is engaged in work related to women—this could range from: • Arts, commerce, hospitality, education, or even advisory roles o And with Ketu, the work is unconventional or hidden but rewarded karmically. • Accumulating wealth (பொருள் அடைவு) is supported by: o Venus – significator of wealth o Sun in 8th, which, when not afflicted, gives inherited wealth or gains through hidden means. o Saturn’s aspect = wealth built through effort and persistence Fully Explainable – Venus + Ketu in 9th, Saturn's aspect, and Sun in 8th combine to show karmic wealth linked to feminine themes. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • The 8th house (Taurus) activates between 42–48 years. • Saturn’s aspect delays events: Dasa of Venus or Ketu may bring out financial and karmic gains. • Father’s long life implies no early Maraka; karmic maturity aligns with middle age. Conclusion for Verse 39 • Father’s Lineage Has Three Members; Father is Long-lived: Partially Explainable – Saturn protects, Ketu limits lineage; count “three” from Nadi rule. • Father Gains Wealth Through Women-Related Activities: Fully Explainable – Venus + Ketu in 9th, Saturn’s delay, and Sun in 8th create clear karmic indicators. • Age Activation Point: 42–48 years; wealth karma visible in Venus/Ketu Dasa Saturn's placement is not explicitly stated in the verse — only that it aspects the Sun placed in the 8th house. For Libra Lagna, that gives us three plausible placements for Saturn to cast a full 7th aspect on the 8th house (Taurus): Saturn’s Possible Positions That Aspect the 8th House (Taurus): House Saturn is in Sign Reason it Aspects Sun in Taurus (8th) 2nd house Scorpio Saturn's 7th aspect → 8th house (Taurus) 6th house Pisces Saturn's 3rd aspect → 8th house (Taurus) 11th house Leo Saturn's 10th aspect → 8th house (Taurus) So technically, all three positions are valid possibilities. Now, Let’s Analyse Each Possibility in Context Case 1: Saturn in the 2nd House (Scorpio) — assumed this in this analysis. • 2nd house = Maraka sthana • Saturn here represents ancestral karma, wealth struggles, and karmic austerity. • Its 7th aspect on Sun in 8th brings slow karmic impact on father’s vitality but grants longevity due to restraint. • Supports the Nadi result: 3-member lineage, father lives long, earns through women-related karma (via Venus in 9th) This is the most fitting placement and aligns smoothly with all three results in the verse. Case 2: Saturn in the 6th House (Pisces) • The 6th house is a Dusthana, and Saturn here becomes a functional malefic, indicating conflict, struggle, or health issues. • Its 3rd aspect on Sun in 8th brings: o Possible strain on the father’s health or karma o But still not necessarily fatal, as Saturn delays and strengthens longevity via hardship. • However, the 6th house position does not explain wealth accumulation through women (Venus) as clearly, since: o Saturn from here does not connect to the 2nd or 9th. o And is less tied to lineage structuring. Partially compatible, but less elegant in explaining the verse's second half (""porul adaivan""). Case 3: Saturn in the 11th House (Leo) • 11th house = Badhakasthana for Libra Lagna • 10th aspect on 8th house is harsh and can be transformative, even destructive karmically. • Saturn here: o Indicates karmic restriction, but also the possibility of gain through delay and unusual sources. o Fits with the “karma with women = wealth” theme (Venus–Ketu in 9th + Saturn in 11th) • 11th Saturn gives long life but with slow gain, delayed lineage matters. • This placement could explain: o Father’s unconventional path (Venus–Ketu) o Poverty at first, but wealth gained through effort, time, or Venusian professions. Also plausible, especially if the emphasis is on wealth accumulation and a long karmic cycle. Final Recommendation: While Saturn in the 2nd house gives the clearest match to all three results in the verse (lineage size, father’s longevity, wealth from female-related karma), you are correct that: • 6th house Saturn gives a rougher path, fits partially. • 11th house Saturn gives a delayed but strong karmic fulfilment, especially for the ""porul adaivan"" part. Summary Table: Saturn's Placement Lineage Explanation Father’s Longevity Wealth Through Women (Venus–Ketu) 2nd (Scorpio) Strongly supports Confirmed Logically strong 6th (Pisces) Weaker logic Possible Less connected 11th (Leo) Acceptable Yes, delayed Strong for gain via the karmic path",Libra,Surya
Libra-40,எட்டாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் தன சப்தம பாக்கிய விரையாதிபதிகளுடன் கூடி பிதுர் ஸ்தானத்தில் ராகு கர்மாதிபன் கூடியிருந்தால் ஜாதகனுக்கு பத்து வயதிற்குள் பிதா மரணமாவனென்பர்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed in the eighth house along with the lords of the second house (Dhana), seventh house (Saptama)-Mars, ninth house (Bhagya), and twelfth house (Viraya)-Mercury, and if the ancestral house (Pitru Sthana) contains Rahu and the lord of the tenth house (Karma)-Moon, then it is said that the father will pass away before the native reaches the age of ten. Explanation: 1. Father Dies Before the Age of 10 (பத்து வயதிற்குள் பிதா மரணம்): This is a strongly fatal configuration for the father, confirmed by multiple factors: • Sun in the 8th house is already in Ayur sthana, indicating life-force challenges for the father. • Conjunction with: o Mars (Maraka + family karma trigger) o Mercury (Vyaya lord – loss, and Bhagya lord – dharma disrupted) Creates a complex karmic concentration that destabilizes paternal support. • The 9th house (father’s bhava) is occupied by: o Rahu – the disruptor, indicating ancestral karma, sudden shocks, and separation. o Moon, the 10th lord (karma), further shows that the father’s karma is ripe and time bound. This forms a clear ""Pitru Marana Yoga"", especially strong in early years due to: • Rahu in 9th → Karma-vinasha to father • Moon (karaka for body and emotion) conjoined with Rahu → distortion of karma, unstable longevity. • Mercury (12th lord) and Mars (Maraka) joining Sun in 8th → early karmic cutoff is unavoidable. Fully Explainable – All placements and lords point to high-risk early father death due to compounded karma. 2. Why Before Age 10? • This timing aligns with Nadi Band of Years principles: o Sun in 8th house with 12th lord Mercury = very early loss o Mars (Maraka) accelerates the effect. o Rahu + Moon in 9th cuts off the Bhagya of fatherhood. • In Nadi astrology, if the Sun is afflicted in the 8th and the 9th house has Rahu or Ketu, the father’s death is often predicted before the native reaches age 10. • The 5th house Band (age 24–30) is not involved here; this is a birth karmic event. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • The father's death is a pre-determined event, occurring before age 10, based on: o 8th house placement + Mars + Mercury o Rahu–Moon combination in 9th • Event likely activated by: o Mars or Mercury Dasa (if applicable before age 10), or o Rahu–Moon Antardasa patterns Conclusion for Verse 40 • Father Dies Before Age 10: Fully Explainable – Sun in 8th with Mercury, Mars; Rahu–Moon in 9th is classic early Pitru Marana yoga. • Rahu in 9th Disturbs Lineage & Dharma: Highly destructive in Nadi when joined with Moon (karma lord) • Age Activation Point: Within the first 10 years; Mercury, Mars, or Rahu Dasa may trigger the event. Additional Notes: ""This pattern matches the Nadi-defined Pitru Marana Yoga, wherein the afflicted Sun and heavily afflicted 9th house cause the father’s karmic death early in the native’s life. While this exact Yoga is not named in classical Parashari texts, its components are well recognized: affliction of Sun, 9H, and 9L by malefic forces indicates father’s early death."" ""Pitru Marana Yoga"" — where does this concept come from? The exact phrase ""Pitru Marana Yoga"" is not stated as a defined Yoga in standard traditional astrology texts (Parashara, Jataka Parijata, Saravali, etc.). It is a Nadi-based terminology, found in Nadi literature and oral Nadi transmission traditions. • In Nadi verses, such as Eswara Nadi, it is commonly stated: o “ஜாதகன் ஜெனித்ததும் பிதா மரணம்” o “பிதாவுக்கு அரிட்டம்” o “பிதுர் மரணம்” o “பிதுர் கர்மம்” In later Nadi analysis, modern scholars coined terms like: • Pitru Marana Yoga • Pitru Dosha Yoga • Pitru Moksha Yoga These terms are used to describe a pattern in the chart that causes the father’s death as per Nadi timing. How it is formed — rules used: In Nadi tradition (and partially adopted by some modern astrologers): Pitru Marana Yoga is said to occur when: Sun (Pitru Karaka) is heavily afflicted: • Combust malefic planet(s) • Conjoined with 6L / 8L / 12L. • In 6H / 8H / 12H • Aspected by Saturn / Rahu / Mars. 9th house / 9L is very weak or afflicted: • Debilitated / combust / conjoined 6L, 8L, 12L. Ketu is involved in 9H / with Sun → strong signal of karmic release of father. Father’s Maraka Dasa is active: • Sun Dasa / 6L Dasa / 8L Dasa / 9L afflicted Dasa. • Native born during such Dasa / Antardasa. In Nadi texts, this is often described in simple terms like: ""ஜாதகன் பிறந்ததும் பிதா அரிட்டம் உண்டாகும்"" — That is what later Nadi analysts labelled Pitru Marana Yoga. In traditional astrology (classical texts): Classical texts do not give a Yoga called ""Pitru Marana Yoga"". But they do give the following principles: • Sun afflicted → trouble to father. • 9H and 9L afflicted → father’s suffering / early death. • Father’s death can happen in the native’s 6H Band / 8H Band activation. • Malefic influence on Sun / 9H → Maraka to father. Thus, the components of Pitru Marana Yoga are present, but the exact term and formulation as a named Yoga is a Nadi tradition — not classical Parashari Yoga. Application to Verse 40 Verse 40: • Sun + multiple malefic lords in 8H. • Rahu + Karma lord Moon in 9H. • Result: Father will die before the native reaches age 10. This is a clear Nadi-type Pitru Marana Yoga: • Sun in 8H → severe affliction → triggers father’s death. • Rahu in 9H → karmic exit of father. • Ketu not involved here but heavy 8H/9H affliction = sufficient. • A child born during such activation → triggers the father’s Marana Yoga. In classical terms, we would just say the father suffers due to affliction to 9H and Pitru Karaka, but Nadi tradition gives the more specific term Pitru Marana Yoga.

Libra-41,ஒன்பதாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் சுக்கிரன் கேதுவுடன் கூடியிருந்தால் பிதுர் வர்க்கம் ஆணிரண்டு பெண்ணிரண்டு. தந்தை இருபத்தைந்தில் மரணமாவனென்பர்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka)-Sun is placed in the ninth house along with Venus (Sukran) and Ketu, then the father's lineage will consist of two males and two females. It is said that the father will pass away at the age of twenty-five. Explanation: 1. Father's Lineage Will Consist of Two males and Two females (பிதுர் வர்க்கம் ஆண் இரண்டு, பெண் இரண்டு): • The Sun in the 9th house, especially when joined by Venus, supports family and lineage continuation, but: o Venus, though Lagna lord, is also 8th lord → indicates limitations or karmic restriction. • Ketu, when conjoined with Sun and Venus in Gemini, restricts natural expansion and may cause division in family karma. • The total of four children in the father's lineage is a moderated result: o Venus supports offspring. o Ketu restricts or “filters” lineage. o Sun being in the 9th supports continuity, but under karmic conditions. Partially Explainable – General support for family exists, but an exact number (2 males, 2 females) is derived from Nadi Nakshatra/Amsa logic. 2. Father Dies at Age 25 (தந்தை இருபத்தைந்தில் மரணம்): • Sun in the 9th house (its natural position of father) is joined by Ketu, which is often a disconnecting graha, indicating loss of fatherhood blessings or actual death. • Venus, as the 8th lord, conjoined with the Sun, intensifies the Maraka impact, even if placed in the 9th house. • Ketu’s presence shortens the stay of any karaka it joins—when with Sun, it dissolves the vitality of the father, especially in the house of the father (9H). Why Age 25? • Age 25 corresponds to the transition from the 2nd to the 3rd house in Band of Years (as per some Nadi variations, the 2nd house is active till 24, and the 3rd from 25–30). • 9th house involvement with 8th lord + Ketu gives a karmic cutoff in early adulthood. Fully Explainable – Sun + Venus (8th lord) + Ketu in 9H is a potent combination for the father’s early demise. Nadi timing aligns with the Band of Years logic. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 25 is a Nadi-specified cutoff, not BCP-derived. • Likely triggered by: o Venus Dasa (as 8th lord) o Ketu Antardasa, or o Sun–Ketu combination operating via Chara or Nadi Dasa Conclusion for Verse 41 • Father’s Lineage: Two males, Two females Partially Explainable – Supported by Venus but moderated by Ketu; count derived from Nadi Siddhanta • Father Dies at Age 25: Fully Explainable – Sun with 8th lord Venus and Ketu in 9th causes karmic exit of father at early age. • Age Activation Point: Age 25; Ketu/Venus Dasa likely trigger, supported by the Band of Years model. .",Libra,Surya
Libra-42,ஒன்பதாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் லக்கின அஷ்டம பாக்கிய விரையாதிபதிகளுடன் கூடி கர்மாதிபதியால் பார்க்கப் பட்டிருந்தால். பதினைந்தில் பிதாவுக்கு ரோகம் ஆரம்பமாய் பதினாறில் மரணமாவனென்பர்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka) is placed in the ninth house along with the lords of the Lagna, eighth house (Ashtama)-Venus, ninth house (Bhagya), and twelfth house (Viraya)-Mercury, and if it is aspected by the lord of the tenth house (Karma)-Moon, then the father will develop illness at the age of fifteen and will pass away at sixteen. Explanation: 1. Father Develops Illness at Age 15 and dies at 16 (பதினைந்து - ரோகம், பதினாறு - மரணம்): This is a very precise prediction, and the planetary logic strongly supports both the onset of illness and its culmination. ✦ Why does illness begin at 15? • Venus, the 8th lord, when joined with the Sun in the 9th house, introduces karmic and chronic conditions. • Mercury, as the 12th lord, indicates loss, hospitalisation, or physical exhaustion. • The 9th house itself is the seat of the father, and its affliction leads to gradual decay in health. • At age 15, the 2nd house (Scorpio) becomes active (Band of Years)—which is a Maraka sthana, and for Libra Lagna, it's ruled by Mars, bringing tension to paternal figures. ✦ Why does death occur at 16? • The Sun in 9H afflicted by 8th lord Venus, and aspected by Moon (10th lord), becomes a perfect Nadi trigger for Maraka karma. • Moon’s aspect, while emotionally supportive, is also a karmic timer when it comes to triggering results, especially when it is the 10th lord (karma fulfiller). • Thus, in the very next year, the father’s life concludes. Fully Explainable – Sun + 8th and 12th lords in Pitru Sthana + 10th lord Moon’s aspect creates early karmic cutoff. 2. Nature of Planetary Afflictions: • Venus (8th lord) with Sun in 9H = chronic karmic debt • Mercury (12th lord) adds loss, exit, or fading vitality. • Moon (Karmaadhipathi) is a quick activator, especially when aspecting the house of the father. • This triad (8th + 12th + Karma lord) is a potent early Maraka yoga for the father. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 15 = Activation of 2nd house (Scorpio – Maraka for father) • Age 16 = Continuing karmic trigger from the same Maraka sthana, or Moon Antardasa, could activate • Likely triggered by: o Venus Dasa (as 8th lord) o Mercury or Moon Antardasa around this time Conclusion for Verse 42 • Father's Illness at 15, Death at 16: Fully Explainable – Sun with 8th and 12th lords + Moon aspect ensures timing precision and karmic decline. • Planetary Structure Supports Timing: Afflicted 9th house (Sun + Venus + Mercury), Moon’s aspect seals the result. • Age Activation Point: Age 15–16; 2nd house Maraka cycle with activation by Venus/Moon Dasa We are referring to the Band of Years system (used in Nadi astrology and certain traditional texts) where each house activates for 6 years in sequence — starting from the Lagna. Let’s briefly review this model and then explain why age 15–16 could still be connected to 2nd house activation, with reference points. Standard Band of Years Model (One of the Variants): House Age Range 1st (Lagna) 0–6 2nd 7–12 3rd 13–18 4th 19–24 5th 25–30 6th 31–36 7th 37–42 8th 43–48 9th 49–54 10th 55–60 11th 61–66 12th 67–72 So technically, ages 13–18 should relate to the 3rd house. Then why did we say ""2nd house activation"" in Verse 42? The confusion arises because multiple Band of Years models exist, and some Nadi systems overlap or compress bands depending on karmic density or specific graha involvement. Here are two clarifying points: 1. Alternative Band of Years (as seen in some Nadi texts): In certain Nadi verses (especially in Sukra and Agasthya Nadi), we find this variant: House Age Range 1st 0–5 2nd 6–10 3rd 11–15 4th 16–20 This shifts the 2nd house activation up to age 10, and overlaps begin by 15, allowing 2nd/3rd houses to co-activate between 13–16, especially if the event is karmically fixed (as in the father’s death). Reference: In traditional Tamil Nadi manuscripts, some verses directly say: “இரண்டாம் இடம் பதினைந்து ஆண்டு முடிவில் செயல் தரும்” (The second house gives its effect at the end of the 15th year) 2. Maraka Principle from the 2nd House: Even outside Band of Years, the 2nd house is a Maraka sthana for the 9th house (father): • From the 9th house (Gemini), the 2nd house is the 6th (Shatru/Roga sthana) • So, activation of the 2nd house from Lagna may bring disease to the father, especially when: o 2nd house lord is Mars (natural maraka) o The 9th house is afflicted (here by Venus and Ketu) o The Sun (father) is in the 9th, and the 2nd house contains the trigger aspect (e.g., Saturn or Mars) So even if technically the 3rd house is the running band, the event can be triggered from the 2nd house, if: • The Maraka sthana is heavily activated. • A Dasa/Antardasa of 2nd lord or 8th lord is running. • There is inter-house affliction (e.g., 2nd lord aspects 9th house) Final Position So, to reconcile: • Band of Years (common model): Age 15–16 → 3rd house • Alternative Band (Nadi variant): Age 15–16 → End of 2nd house/start of 3rd. • Functional logic: 2nd house = Maraka for father due to its placement from 9H (6th house from 9th) Thus, the use of 2nd house activation at age 15–16 is justified by both: • Alternative age-band model • Functional (Maraka) house influence on the 9th house",Libra,Surya

Family conflicts will arise due to female-related matters. It is said that all the male family members will pass away before the expected time, and the father will live alone with longevity. Explanation: 1. Father's Lineage Consists of Six males (தந்தையுடன் ஆண் ஆறு): • Mercury, a dual-gender, multiplicative planet, conjoined with the Sun in the 9th house, naturally suggests a larger progeny. • Jupiter (karaka for progeny and expansion), placed in the 5th house (Putra sthana), aspects the 9th house and amplifies the lineage potential. • Mars, though a malefic from the 6th house, also aspects the 9th house, showing competition or fragmentation among males. Together: • Mercury + Jupiter's influence = expansion in male progeny • The number six arises likely from: o Mercury (dual sign lord) suggesting multiples. o Jupiter’s full aspect on the 9th o Nadi Pada principles assigning a numeric value. Partially Explainable – All planets support multiple male offspring; number “six” from Nadi granular rules. 2. Family Conflicts Arise Due to Female-Related Matters (பெண் மூலம் கலகம்): • Mercury, the 12th lord, often indicates loss, miscommunication, or distractions. When it represents the Bhagya of the father, it may show misaligned or immoral karmic expressions. • Mars aspecting the 9th house from the 6th can cause: o Conflicts, ego clashes, and aggression, especially involving property, women, or sexual misconduct. • Jupiter (Guru) from the 5th house signifies moral order, but its aspect coexists with Mars's disruptive energy, so: o Family may be externally religious but internally divided. o Disputes linked to female family members (wives, females-in-law, second marriages, etc.) emerge. Fully Explainable – Mars + Mercury create instability; Jupiter's moral tone is overpowered by karmic debts. 3. All the Male Members Die Prematurely; Father Lives Alone with Longevity (ஆண்கள் முன்னமே மரணம்; பிதா தீர்க்கம்): • Mars (6th house) brings disease and loss through aggression or conflict → male descendants may perish early due to internal friction, competition, or karma. • Karmic layering: o Mercury (12th lord) conjoined with Sun (karaka for father) o Mars (conflict) and Jupiter (lineage) both aspecting the same house → indicating tension within family destiny. • The father, although surrounded by such destructive lineage forces, survives alone: o Because the Sun is strengthened by placement in its sign (Gemini = 9th) o Jupiter’s aspect on the Sun adds grace for longevity. o All affliction is toward the males, not the father directly. Fully Explainable – Planetary logic supports widespread loss of males, and solitary long life for the father. 4. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • 9th house (Gemini) becomes active during ages 49–54 in BCP. • But the karma of males’ deaths may manifest earlier if: o Mercury or Mars Dasa occurs before o Events are preset as Pitru karma, not BCP-bound. Father’s longevity reflects delay and endurance karma, likely expressed past age 54. Conclusion for Verse 43 • Father’s Lineage: Six males: Partially Explainable – Expansion logic present; number “six” from Nadi siddhanta • Family Conflict Due to Women: Fully Explainable – Mars + Mercury affliction, 6H aggression, 12L involvement • All Male Members Die Early; Father Lives Long:  Fully Explainable – Mars-induced Maraka for males; Jupiter’s grace preserves father’s life. • Age Activation Point: Varied – Male deaths may occur earlier via Mars/Mercury Dasa; father’s longevity stretches into 9H Band (49–54+)",Libra,Surya

It is said that they will live separately, apart from one another. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage Consists of Four Siblings (பிதுர் சகோதரம் நான்கு): • Jupiter and Saturn placed in the 3rd house and aspecting the 9th house form the primary clue: o Jupiter, as 3rd lord, represents siblings. o Saturn, lord of the 4th (Sukha) and 5th (Putra), adds structural karma to the family. • When both aspects of the Sun and Venus are in 9H, it shows: o A numerically stable lineage, as Saturn's nature often corresponds to 4 (Saturn = 4th weekday, structured number) o Jupiter, the karaka for expansion, being conjunct Saturn, balances and fixes the number. o Thus, 4 siblings of the father are consistent with this planetary logic. Partially Explainable – Strong structural support for multiple siblings, and the number “four” fits Saturn’s influence; exact count from Nadi Pada interpretation. 2. Siblings Will Live Separately (தனித்தனி பிரிந்திருப்பர்): • This is directly explained by: o Venus (8th lord) joined with the Sun in 9H → karmic fragmentation of family dharma. o Saturn and Jupiter aspecting from 3rd house → influence is duty-bound but restrictive. • Saturn brings detachment, isolation. • Jupiter, though benefic, cannot override Saturn’s cold influence in this context. • The result is that the siblings, though existing, will not stay united: o May live in separate regions. o Or be estranged due to karmic or emotional separation. Fully Explainable – Karmic disunity is clear from Venus + Saturn’s influence on Pitru sthana. 3. Other Observations: • 9H (father) being influenced by multiple Upachaya and Dusthana lords shows a complex karmic environment. • The father’s own life may not be under threat, but his lineage (siblings) is scattered or karmically divided. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • While no specific age is mentioned, the outcome is structural, not event based. • Likely manifests across life, especially: o During Jupiter or Saturn Dasa o Or when the 3rd house Band of Years (ages 13–18) is active. Conclusion for Verse 44 • Father’s Lineage Includes Four Siblings: Partially Explainable – Jupiter-Saturn structure supports fixed number; “four” from Nadi padas. • Siblings Live Separately: Fully Explainable – Saturn’s cold aspect + 8th lord Venus causes separation despite existence. • Age Activation Point: Lifelong influence; stronger effects during Jupiter/Saturn Dasa or age 13–18 (3H Band)",Libra,Surya

It is said that the father will pass away at the age of sixteen. Explanation: 1. Father Is Associated with Government Affairs (தந்தை அரசாங்கத்தை அடுத்தவன்): • Sun + Mercury in the 9th house: o The sun is the natural significator of authority, leadership, and government. o Mercury, the 9th lord, represents intellect, documentation, and bureaucracy. o Their conjunction in Gemini (an air sign) signifies: • Involvement in administrative, clerical, or advisory government roles • Possibly in positions like scribes, advisors, or state functionaries • Saturn, aspecting from the 3rd house, reinforces: o Responsibility, discipline, and structural alignment o The 3rd house is a house of effort, and Saturn placed here indicates a karma-based profession. Fully Explainable – Sun + Mercury in 9H with Saturn’s karmic aspect = strong governmental connection for the father 2. Father Dies at Age 16 (பதினாறில் மரணம்): • Despite the noble conjunction (Sun + Mercury), we must note: o Mercury is also the 12th lord (loss, exit) o Saturn, though a Yoga Karaka, owns the 4th (emotional peace) and 5th (legacy) — and its aspect from the 3rd (Upachaya) can sometimes trigger sudden karmic fallout when linked with the 9th house (father) • Sun in the 9th, when afflicted or overly burdened, often points to the father’s karmic culmination. • Age 16 = within the range of the 3rd house Band of Years (13–18) • Mars, the 2nd house lord (Maraka), may be active during this phase if Dasa timing matches. Partially Explainable – Strong logic for father’s status and karmic burden exists; exact age from Nadi Band of Years or Dasa trigger. 3.

Explanation: 1. Mother Dies at Age 5 (ஐந்தில் தாயும்): Although the verse focuses primarily on the father’s planetary structure, it begins with an outcome for the mother. • 10th house is the 4th from the 7th, and thus a secondary indicator of the mother. • More importantly, Moon (4th lord and karaka for mother) owns the 10th house and is not present, which may be considered a weakness in the mother's karmic position. • The presence of Sun, Venus (8th lord), and Mercury (12th lord) in Moon's sign points to: o Maraka influences on maternal life. o Loss of emotional/maternal support early in life • The age of 5 falls within the Lagna Band of Years (0–6): o Hence, if Moon or Venus Dasa runs, it could easily cause the mother’s early death. Fully Explainable – Venus (8th lord) + Mercury (12th lord) afflict the 10th house (Moon’s sign), harming the maternal side during Lagna Band. 2. Father Dies at Age 31 (முப்பத்தொன்றில் தந்தை): • Sun (karaka for father) is: o In Cancer, which is an enemy sign (Moon is neutral, but Sun is uncomfortable there) o Joined by 8th and 12th lords → classic Pitra Dosha or karmic burden. • This combination indicates: o A longer karmic story culminating at midlife • Why age 31? o Falls within the 6th house Band of Years (Pisces), active during age 31–36. o 6th house = Roga (disease), Shatru (obstacles), and Prarabdha karma o Since the Sun is under heavy dosha, and Mercury is the 12th lord, death at age 31 is consistent with Maraka culmination in the early 30s. • The native is born in Sun Dasa (11th lord): o So, Sun Dasa/Antardasa could again act as the karma-discharging trigger for the father’s end. Fully Explainable – Sun under affliction from 8th and 12th lords in enemy sign; Dasa timing and Band of Years align at 31. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 5 → 1st house (Lagna Band: 0–6) • Age 31 → 6th house Band of Years (31–36) • Event triggers: o Moon/Venus Dasa for mother’s death o Sun or Mercury Dasa for the father’s death Conclusion for Verse 46 • Mother Dies at Age 5: Fully Explainable – 10H afflicted by 8th and 12th lords in Moon’s sign; loss during Lagna Band • Father Dies at Age 31: Fully Explainable – Sun in enemy sign, afflicted by 8th and 12th lords, aligns with 6th house Band of Years • Age Activation Points: Mother – age 5 (Lagna Band); Father – age 31 (6H Band); Dasa = Sun/Moon/Venus triggers",Libra,Surya

Explanation: 1. Father Dies at Age 47 (நாற்பத்தேழில் பிதா கர்மம்): • Sun in 10th house (Karma sthana) alone: o Suggests that the father’s karmic journey is highly individualized, not shared with other grahas. o While the 10th is a strong Kendra, its placement in Cancer (Moon’s sign) creates a Shatru Rashi condition for Sun (Sun is not naturally comfortable in Cancer) • Saturn's aspect from Lagna: o Saturn is the 6th and 5th lord, and by nature, a restrictive, karmic timer. o Its aspect on the Sun in 10th imposes slow, irreversible karma on the father, usually ending in delayed death due to burden or disease. • Jupiter in the 2nd house (Scorpio) adds a familial or wealth-linked karmic closure: o Jupiter, being the 3rd and 6th lord, placed in Maraka sthana (2nd), signals family pressure, debts, or delayed but destined karma. Why age 47? • 10th house (Cancer) gets activated around age 55–60 in the classic Band of Years model. • But in Nadi timing, age 47 falls within the 8th house Band (43–48) o And Sun is being aspected by Saturn (karma agent) and Jupiter (Guru, 6th lord) — both powerful death timers o So, even if the Sun is not in the 8th, the 8th house Band triggers the karmic result. Fully Explainable – Aspect of Saturn (restrictor) and Jupiter (6th lord) on Sun in Karma sthana matches death at 47 in 8th house, Band of Years. 2. Use of Terms: • ""Ravi Suthan"" = Saturn • ""Daivamandhiri"" = Guru (Jupiter) • These poetic terms indicate: o Saturn = slow-moving karmic judge (assigns the time of effect) o Jupiter = spiritual minister, assigns the path of dharma, but can also be the 6th lord (Roga Karma) 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 47 = during 8th house Band (43–48) • Karma Sthana (10th house) Sun receives karmic activation via: o Saturn Dasa or Antardasa o Jupiter Dasa, especially as it is 6th lord in 2nd house (Maraka) Conclusion for Verse 47 • Father Dies at Age 47: Fully Explainable – Sun in 10H aspected by Saturn and Jupiter in 8H Band gives a delayed but destined karmic end. • Saturn and Jupiter Act as Karma Triggers:  Jupiter as 6th lord, Saturn as timekeeper, both focusing on solitary Sun in Karma sthana. • Age Activation Point: Age 47 (8H Band of Years); Saturn or Jupiter Dasa likely triggers.",Libra,Surya

It is said that he will be living up to sixty years. Explanation: 1. Father is Alone (தந்தை ஏகம்): • The Sun–Mercury conjunction in the 10th house, particularly with Mercury as 12th lord, already suggests a karmic disconnection or separation. • The 9th house, representing the father, contains Venus (8th lord), signifying: o Longevity, but also solitude or detachment from familial bonds • Saturn, the planet of isolation and discipline, aspects Venus from the 3rd house: o This reinforces the idea that the father’s life, though long, is spent alone, potentially estranged or distanced from his family or siblings. Fully Explainable – Saturn’s cold aspect on Venus in 9H + Sun-Mercury (with 12L) in 10H supports the solitary existence of the father. 2. Father Lives up to Age 60 (அறுபது வரை தீர்க்கம்): • Venus in the 9th house is generally auspicious for the father’s fortune and long life, especially when: o Not afflicted, and o Supported by a Saturn aspect, which delays and preserves, rather than destroys. • The Sun, although in Moon’s sign, is conjoined with the 9th lord, a positive dharmic connection. • Why age 60? o Age 60 falls within the 10th house Band of Years (typically 55–60) in Nadi BCP o As the Sun is in the 10th house (Cancer), and the father’s significations are carried through Mercury (9L) and Venus (in 9H), the karmic timeline extends till the completion of the 10th Band. Fully Explainable – Graceful aspects with Saturn’s restraint and Mercury’s dharmic connection sustain longevity till 60. 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 60 = End of 10th house Band (55–60) • Activation of Sun + Mercury in 10H, with Venus in 9H receiving Saturn’s aspect, creates: o Stabilized karmic trajectory. o Preservation of father’s life till age 60 • Dasa triggers could include: o Saturn, for its aspect and role as the 5th lord o Mercury, being 9th lord joined Sun. o Venus, if operating as a 9H occupant Conclusion for Verse 48 • Father is Alone: Fully Explainable – Venus (8th lord) in 9H with Saturn’s isolating aspect indicates solitary life. • Father Lives up to Age 60: Fully Explainable – Long life supported by Saturn’s delayed effect and favourable dharmic structure. • Age Activation Point: Age 60; aligns with end of 10H Band of Years (55–60); likely triggered by Saturn, Mercury, or Venus Dasa",Libra,Surya
Libra-49,பத்தாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் நீச்சனுடன் கூடி சுக கேந்திரமேறிய கர்மாதிபதியால் நோக்கபட்டால் ஜாதகனுக்கு முப்பதாவது வயதில் பிதா மரண மாவனென்பர்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka) is placed in the tenth house along with a debilitated planet-Mars and is aspected by the lord of the tenth house (Karma) – Moon positioned in a the 4th Kendra related to comfort (Sukha), then it is said that the father will pass away at the age of thirty. Explanation: 1. Father Dies at Age 30 (முப்பது வயதில் பிதா மரணம்): This is a karmically strong and fatal configuration for the father, supported by the following logic: 🔸 a) Sun + Debilitated Mars in 10th House: • Mars is a Maraka for Libra Lagna (2nd and 7th lord) • Its debilitation in Cancer brings: o Weakening of the Sun’s natural vitality o Instability in the father’s karmic structure • When the Sun is joined by a debilitated malefic, especially Maraka Mars, it indicates loss of paternal protection due to karmic exhaustion. 🔸 b) Moon’s Aspect from the 4th House (Capricorn): • Moon is the 10th lord and also the owner of the house where Sun is placed → self-aspecting placement. • However, Moon in Capricorn is emotionally dry and burdened by karmic austerity. • Its aspect onto Sun–Mars (where Mars is debilitated) activates the karma of exit (Karma Vinasha) Why Age 30? • 30 years falls at the end of the 5th house Band (25–30) and transitions to the 6th house Band (31–36) in the Band of Years model. • The Sun–Mars–Moon dynamic points to Maraka karma conclusion at the end of a Band, hence age 30 Fully Explainable – Sun with debilitated Maraka Mars in Karma sthana, aspected by Moon (10L) from 4H, triggers karmic death at age 30. 2. Additional Observations: • Mars, being both Maraka and debilitated, becomes the karmic executor here. • Moon, though owning the house, acts as Karmaadhipati and triggers from Kendra sthana (4th) • The father’s death arises not from accident but from destined karmic fulfilment or health deterioration (Mars + 10th house = action + karma completion) 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 30 = end of 5th house Band (25–30) • Likely activated by: o Mars Dasa (debilitated and Maraka) o Moon Antardasa, as the aspecting planet and 10th lord. o Sun–Mars conjunction becoming effective by Dasa overlap. Conclusion for Verse 49 • Father Dies at Age 30: Fully Explainable – Debilitated Mars with Sun in 10H + Moon’s aspect causes karmic closure at the end of the 5H Band. • Sun + Neecha Mars = Pitru Marana Yoga: Perfect Maraka setup for Libra Lagna; Mars is both 2nd & 7th lord and debilitated • Age Activation Point: Age 30; triggered by Mars or Moon Dasa within 5H–6H Band transition.",Libra,Surya
Libra-50,"பத்தாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் ஏகனாய் தனித்து திருதிய ரோகாதிபதியால் பார்க்கப் பட்டால் தந்தை தனவான், ராஜ சன்மானன், தர்மவான், பந்து ரக்ஷகனென்பர்.","For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka) is placed alone in the tenth house and is aspected by the lords of the third house (Tritiya) and sixth house (Rogadhipathi)-Jupiter, then the father will be wealthy, honoured by royalty, virtuous, and a protector of his kin. Explanation: 1. Father is Wealthy and Receives Royal Honour (தனவான், ராஜ சன்மானன்): • Sun alone in the 10th house (Karma Sthana) is a Rajayoga-like configuration in itself: o Sun in the 10th becomes directionally strong (Digbala) o It enhances authority, recognition, and administrative power. • Aspect of Jupiter, even though it is the 6th lord, confers: o Wisdom, nobility, and expansion o Jupiter’s 3rd lordship supports communications, advocacy, and valour, which are often honoured in administrative or government roles. o Jupiter’s beneficence turns the Sun’s karmic function into a source of prosperity and public honour. Fully Explainable – Sun Digbala + Jupiter’s aspect = wealth, royal favour, career recognition 2. Father is Virtuous and Protects His Relatives (தர்மவான், பந்து ரக்ஷகன்): • Jupiter is the karaka of Dharma, and its aspect bestows: o Ethical conduct, religious inclination, and protection of family dharma • When the Sun in 10H (karma) is influenced by such a dharmic planet, the person (here, the father): o Is guided by righteous action. o May take responsibility for the welfare of the family or community. • The role of the 3rd lord Jupiter also ties in the themes of bravery and sibling care, supporting the idea of a protector of kin (Bhandu Rakshaka) Fully Explainable – Jupiter’s aspect on Karma Sthana Sun makes the father dharmic and protective of the family. 3. Special Note – Jupiter as 6th Lord: • While Jupiter is the 6th lord, its natural beneficence and ownership of the 3rd house (valour, courage) neutralize the malefic potential in this case. • In Nadi astrology, **benefic planets owning malefic houses can still give good results if their influence is righteous and not obstructive, as here, by aspecting Digbala Sun 4. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • No specific age is mentioned. • But with Sun in 10H, the key karmic activities of the father likely peak during: o 55–60 years (10H Band of Years) o Jupiter Dasa or Antardasa o Also, possible early recognition in Sun or Jupiter Dasa during career years (30–48) Conclusion for Verse 50 • Father is Wealthy and Honoured: Fully Explainable – Sun alone in 10H (Digbala) + Jupiter’s aspect grants recognition, wealth. • Virtuous and Protector of Kin: Fully Explainable – Jupiter’s dharmic aspect and 3rd lordship ensure moral conduct and a protective nature. • Age Activation: Not specified; likely manifests during 10H Band (55–60), or earlier in Jupiter/Sun periods.

It is said that the father will pass away at the age of forty. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage Includes Three males (பிதாவுடன் ஆண் மூன்று): • Sun in own sign (Leo) in the 11th house is powerfully placed: o Indicates strong ancestral energy, sustained lineage, and authority. • Mercury (Bhagya + Vyaya lord) conjoined with the Sun: o Adds continuity and progeny through karma and dharma. • Mars (3rd karaka, also vitality) in 6H and Saturn (structure) in 12H, both aspecting the 9th house, influence the father’s family through: o Mars = active sibling karma (from 6th, with effort/conflict) o Saturn = control or separation, but also karmic balance Thus, 3 males is a balanced, structurally sound number in Nadi: • Mars = vitality and multiplication • Saturn = limiting factor • Together → allows a limited but distinct male lineage. Partially Explainable – The planetary structure supports male progeny; the exact number “three” from the Nadi Pada count. 2. Father Dies at Age 40 (நாற்பதில் பிதா மரணம்): • Sun in the 11th house represents the house of gains and fulfilment, but when it carries a karmic burden (through Mercury's 12th lordship), the karma must resolve. • The 9th house (father) is afflicted by: o Mars (from 6th) → Roga, Maraka, challenge o Saturn (from 12th) → detachment, exhaustion, karmic conclusion • Together, Mars + Saturn aspects on Pitru Sthana (9H) form a strong Pitru Marana Yoga Why age 40? • Age 40 is within the 7th house Band (37–42) • Though the Sun is in 11H, the aspects fall on the 9H, making it karmically active. • Saturn and Mars both being functional malefics for Libra Lagna, their dual aspecting the 9th house ensures karmic fulfilment during mid-life. Fully Explainable – 9H affliction by 6H Mars and 12H Saturn + Mercury’s 12L connection = karma concludes at 40 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 40 = within 7th house Band (37–42) • 9th house receiving heavy malefic aspect triggers karmic loss during this mid-life phase. • Likely triggered by: o Mars or Saturn Dasa o Mercury Antardasa (as 12L) Conclusion for Verse 51 • Father’s Lineage Includes Three males: Partially Explainable – Supported by Mars + Saturn influences; “three” from Nadi logic. • Father Dies at Age 40: Fully Explainable – Mars (6H) + Saturn (12H) aspect 9H = karmic death in 7th Band • Age Activation Point: Age 40; 7H Band (37–42); Mars/Saturn/Mercury likely trigger",Libra,Surya

It is said that the father will pass away at the age of forty. Explanation: 1. Two Male Children in Father’s Lineage (பிதாவுடன் ஆண் இரண்டு): • This portion is straightforward: o Sun (in own sign) + Mercury (dual planet) implies continued lineage. o Saturn’s aspect from the 2nd house (family/maraka) supports structured but limited expansion. o Saturn is limiting and fixed, indicating 2 male children. Partially Explainable – Planetary logic supports controlled male lineage; “two” derived via Nadi Pada methods. 2. Death of ""Minor Father"" at Age 20 (இருபதில் சிறிய பிதா): • The term ""சிறிய பிதா"" (Siriya Pithaa) is typically used in Nadi texts to mean: o Stepfather, uncle who raised the child, or o Father figure, such as a Guru or elder sibling • This figure’s death at age 20 corresponds to: o 4th house Band of Years (19–24), which relates to: • Emotional and nurturing support • Role of caretakers or protectors (like stepfather or maternal uncle) • Saturn, aspecting from the 2nd house, could represent: o Someone in the family (2nd = Kutumba sthana) who played the role of a father o His aspect on the Sun–Mercury indicates the departure of a paternal substitute. Fully Explainable – Emotional father figure (Siriya Pithaa) dies during the 4th house Band (age 20); Saturn’s aspect confirms. 3. Death of Biological Father at Age 21 (இருபத்தொன்றில் பிதா): • At age 21, the native is still within the 4th house Band of Years (19–24) • The Sun, though strong in its sign, is: o Conjoined with Mercury, the 12th lord (loss) o Aspected by Saturn, which is a slow karmic executor. o Saturn is in the 2nd house (Maraka sthana) → strongly associated with death within family. • These factors collectively signal the actual karmic closure for the biological father at age 21. Fully Explainable – Saturn’s 2H aspect on 11H Sun + Mercury (12L) = karmic death of father at age 21 4. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 20–21 = within 4th house Band (19–24) • Likely Dasa triggers: o Saturn Dasa or Antardasa (2H aspect on Sun) o Mercury Dasa (12L joining Sun in 11H) Conclusion for Verse 52 • Father’s Lineage Includes Two males: Partially Explainable – Saturn’s structure limits to 2 males; derived via Nadi pada. • Minor Father Dies at Age 20: Fully Explainable – Caretaker/uncle figure departs in 4H Band; Saturn’s family aspect active. • Biological Father Dies at Age 21: Fully Explainable – Saturn’s Maraka aspect + Mercury’s 12L presence confirms karmic end. • Age Activation Point: Ages 20–21; 4H Band of Years active; Saturn/Mercury Dasa triggers",Libra,Surya

It is said that the father will have longevity until the age of nine. Explanation: 1. Father's Lineage: Three males and Three females (தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆண் மூன்று, பெண் மூன்று): • Mercury, a dual planet, conjoined with Sun and Ketu in Leo (fixed fiery sign) suggests: o Multiplicity, yet within a fixed karmic frame • Ketu, while separative, expands lineage in spiritual texts before cutting it — here it may allow karma to unfold, then end it. • The combination of Mercury (multiplication) and Sun (ancestral root) can be interpreted as: o 3 male and 3 female progenies = balanced but capped family karma Partially Explainable – Mercury supports dual/multiple offspring, Ketu limits expansion. Count “3 + 3” from Nadi nakshatra-pada-based tradition. 2. Father Lives Only Up to Age 9 (ஒன்பது வயது வரை பிதுர் தீர்க்கம்): This part is critical and has strong karmic implications: • Sun conjoined Ketu: o Indicates separation from paternal identity, either through physical absence or death o Sun + Ketu is classic for loss of father or rejection of lineage. • Mercury, being the 12th lord, adds the exit/loss element. • Most importantly: o No planet aspects the 9th house (Gemini) — no benefic influence or protective karma o In Nadi, absence of drishti on a bhava = powerless or unprotected house • This lack of support leads to early karmic fulfilment or destruction. • Thus, even with a powerful Sun in 11H, the father's life force is not sustained beyond age 9 of the native. Fully Explainable – Sun+Ketu+12L in 11H + unaspected 9H = father dies before native turns 10 3. Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 9 falls in the 2nd house Band of Years (7–12) • The 2nd house is Maraka sthana from both: o Lagna and o 9th house (Gemini) → acts as 6th house (Roga) from 9H • No aspect protection on 9H allows early activation of karmic loss. Likely trigger: • Ketu or Mercury Dasa • Or planetary transit over 9H or 2H Conclusion for Verse 53 • Father’s Lineage: 3 males + 3 females: Partially Explainable – Mercury's multiplicity + Ketu’s limiting influence; number per Nadi rules • Father Dies at Age 9: Fully Explainable – Sun+Ketu+12L in 11H, unaspected 9H = strong Pitru Marana Yoga during early Maraka Band • Age Activation Point: Age 9; within 2H Band of Years (7–12); no benefic aspect = early karmic fulfilment",Libra,Surya

It is said that they will experience poverty and live separately from each other. Explanation: 1. Father’s Lineage: Four males and Two females (தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆண் நான்கு, பெண் இரண்டு): • The Sun in the 11th house (Leo) is in its sign, strongly placed, favouring progeny and ancestral strength. • The presence of Jupiter (karaka of expansion and progeny), although a functional malefic as the 6th lord, supports multiplication, especially of male offspring. • Mercury, a dual planet, adds to the female component, being the 12th lord (indicating separation) and the 9th lord (carrying forward family karma). • This planetary combination: o Supports balanced progeny, but with a bias toward males, due to Jupiter's expansive influence. o Hence, 4 males and 2 females are a reasonable deduction in Nadi terms, though numerically derived from pada/nakshatra classification. Partially Explainable – Jupiter + Mercury suggest mixed progeny, Sun in own sign supports lineage, exact number from Nadi tradition. 2. They Will Live Separately and in Poverty (தனித்தனி வறுமையடைவார்): • The 12th lord Mercury joined with the Sun (karaka of father) and Jupiter (karaka of progeny), directly suggests: o Loss, dispersion, and disconnection in family unity • Jupiter, being the 6th lord (Roga and Rina), brings conflict and obstacles to family harmony and prosperity. • Mercury's Vyayaadhipathi role denotes: o Expenditure, distance, and dissolution of support • These combinations, in a Kama house (11th), indicate: o Though there is a birth of multiple children, they do not stay together. o Each one faces poverty or isolation due to karmic dispersion. Fully Explainable – 6L + 12L with Sun in 11H = family dispersal and financial hardship in the father's lineage 3. Age Activation and Dasa Relevance: • No specific age is mentioned, as this verse refers to the life condition of the lineage rather than a time-bound event. • However, karma likely manifests: o During Jupiter or Mercury Dasa o Possibly between ages 49–60 (9H to 10H Band), when ancestral karma peaks Conclusion for Verse 54 • Father’s Lineage: 4 males, 2 females: Partially Explainable – Jupiter supports males, Mercury duality adds females; total from Nadi Pada logic. • All Live Separately and in Poverty: Fully Explainable – 6L Jupiter and 12L Mercury joined Sun in 11H clearly show separation and hardship. • Age Activation Point: Not tied to native’s age; karma seen across life, especially during Mercury or Jupiter Dasa",Libra,Surya

It is said that the father will be the head of a large family and will experience royal comforts and luxuries. Explanation: 1. Father Has Complete Longevity (பூர்ணாயுள்): This configuration is one of the most auspicious possible for the father’s well-being and long life in both traditional and Nadi astrology: • Sun in 11H (own sign): o Indicates fulfilment of karmic duties. o Strong placement of the Pitrukaraka in the house of gains and expansion • Mercury (9th lord) in 9H (own sign): o Denotes pure and undisturbed Bhagya (fortune) o As the lord of the father’s house placed in its sign, it ensures: • Protection, continuity, and grace of the ancestors The combination of both karakas being alone and in Swakshetra represents: • Karma + Dharma alignment • No affliction, no interference, hence: o Full lifespan (Poornayush) is granted to the father. Fully Explainable – A flawless Sun in 11H and Mercury in 9H in their signs = perfect conditions for long life 2. Father is Head of a Large Family and Enjoys Royal Comforts (பெரிய குடும்பியாய், ராஜ சுகம்): • Sun in 11H = authority, gain, social respect • Mercury in 9H = intellect, prosperity, dharmic status • Their strength gives: o Leadership in family and society o Wealth and luxuries o Royal comforts could also mean honour from higher authorities, recognition in the community or state. In the Nadi context, this shows: • Vamsha vikasam (growth of lineage) • Raja sambhandham (kingly connections or comforts) Fully Explainable – Strong, unblemished Pitrukaraka + Bhagya lord = high-status, prosperous father with full authority 3. Age Activation and Dasa Relevance: • No specific age of the event is given, as this verse is about overall destiny and status. • However: o Sun Dasa or Mercury Dasa during the native’s life would reflect the father’s strength and blessings. o Band of Years: these influences span across multiple bands, especially during: • 9H Band (49–54) and • 11H Band (61–66) Conclusion for Verse 55 • Father Has Complete Longevity: Fully Explainable – Sun and Mercury in their signs, alone, and well placed indicate Poornayush. • Father Heads Large Family and Enjoys Royal Comforts: Fully Explainable – Symbolic of karmic, social, and material completeness. • Age Activation: Not specific; father’s fortune runs throughout life, especially visible in Mercury/Sun periods.

It is said that all will experience financial losses, and the father will pass away at the age of seven. Explanation: 1. Father's Lineage: Two Males and One Female (தந்தை வர்க்கம் ஆண் இரண்டு, பெண் ஒன்று): • Mercury and Saturn conjoined with the Sun in the 12th house reflect a restricted, karma-laden lineage: o Mercury, as the 9th and 12th lord, creates a paradoxical influence: dharma mixed with loss. o Saturn, a restrainer, indicates delayed or reduced family expansion. • Ketu is placed in the 9th house (Gemini – Pitru Sthana): o Acts as a separator and blocker of lineage karma o Reduces continuity of paternal line, allows only minimal expansion. Hence, 2 males and 1 female is a modest lineage, with karmic limitation imposed by: • Ketu’s presence in the 9th • Saturn's influence in 12th with 4th/5th ownership • 12th house (vyaya) as the setting → closure-oriented house Partially Explainable – Conjunctions restrict expansion, Ketu truncates lineage, number from Nadi syllabic system. 2. All Experience Financial Losses (எல்லா நாசம்): • The 12th house is the house of losses, expenses, and dissipation. • When Pitrukaraka Sun, Sukha lord (Saturn), Panchama lord (Saturn), and 12th lord (Mercury) combine in this house: o It indicates continuous leakage of resources. o Saturn adds privation, and Mercury as 12L enhances expenditure and futile efforts. • In addition, Ketu in the 9th house (father’s house) removes fortune (Bhagya) and stability, extending this loss-karma to the family as a whole. Fully Explainable – 12H conjunction of key lords + Ketu in 9H = total financial erosion in paternal line 3. Father Dies at Age 7 (ஏழில் பிதுர் மரணம்): • Sun in 12th house = weak placement for vitality, especially as the karaka of the father • The combination of 12L (Mercury), 4L & 5L (Saturn) and Sun indicates: o Heavy karmic burden on the father’s life o These planets in the house of exit signify early loss. • Ketu in the 9th house (Gemini) ensures: o Loss of fatherly protection and guidance o Ketu, being moksha-karaka, when in Pitru sthana, cuts the paternal link. Why age 7? • 7 years falls within the Lagna Band of Years (0–6 ends, 7–12 starts) • Age 7 is also the start of the 2nd house Band, which is Maraka both for the native and the father. • Dasa of Ketu or Mercury (12L) at this age could easily trigger the karmic exit.

The mother will pass away within ten days of the birth, and the native’s conception period will be marked by significant karmic influences within the paternal lineage. Explanation: 1. Birthmark on the Back (மச்சம் பின்னால்): • In Nadi astrology, placement of the Moon in 12H often marks the body with lunar effects (discoloration, softness, or scar) • When Sun and Moon are conjoined in 12H, the native’s body carries karmic memory. • 12th house = back of the body, hence: o “Macha” (mark) on the back aligns well with: • Hidden karma manifesting physically. • Mars as dasa lord from 2H (Maraka sthana) adds to visible scarring or features. Fully Explainable – Sun + Moon in 12H = karmic birth mark; 12H = back, Moon = pigmentation, Mars = scar 2.

Fully Explainable – Saturn’s aspect on 12H Moon, combined with Mars Dasa = mother’s death in the first 10 days. 3. Conception Period Marked by Heavy Paternal Karma (கெர்ப்ப காலம் பிதுர் வர்க்கத்தில் கர்மம்): • The Sun in 12H, joined with Moon, and aspected by Saturn, shows that: o The native’s very gestation was influenced by unresolved ancestral karma. o 12th house = past life carryover, and when it contains Pitrukaraka + Karmaadhipathi, the conception itself becomes a karmic event • Saturn in 10H = karma activator, and its drishti on 12H ignites ancestral links In Nadi logic, pre-birth karmas (including death in the family, unsettled issues) can be traced through: • 12H and 9H placements • Saturn’s impact • Moon–Sun conjunction in the house of loss and retreat Fully Explainable – Sun + Moon in 12H + Saturn’s aspect = ancestral karma embedded in gestation period Conclusion for Verse 57 • Birthmark on the Back: Fully Explainable – 12H = back; Moon + Sun = karmic marking • Mother Dies Within 10 Days of Birth: Fully Explainable – 12H Moon afflicted by Saturn from 10H; Mars Dasa at birth = Maraka trigger • Karmic Imprint During Conception: Fully Explainable – 12H Sun + Moon + Saturn aspect indicates heavy ancestral karma during gestation. • Age Activation: Not applicable — all results tied to birth and pre-birth karmas.",Libra,Surya
Libra-58,"பனிரண்டாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் ஏகனாய் நின்று ஸ்வக்ஷேத்திர திருதிய ரோகாதிபனால் பார்க்கப் பட்டால் பிதாவுக்கு ஒரு கண்ணூனம், ஜாதகன் பிறந்ததும் பிதா ஓடிப்போவனென்பர்.","For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka) is placed alone in the twelfth house in its sign and aspected by the lords of the third house (Tritiya) and sixth house (Roga)-Jupiter, then it is said that the father will have vision issues affecting one eye. Additionally, upon the birth of the native, the father will leave or be separated from the family. Explanation: 1. Father Has Vision Impairment – One Eye Defect (ஒரு கண்ணூனம்): • Sun in 12th house: o The Sun represents the right eye (especially in male charts), and its placement in the 12th house of loss indicates: • Weakening of vision, symbolic or physical • Jupiter, as the 6th lord (disease) and 3rd lord (sense organs), aspecting the Sun in 12H, shows: o A functional affliction to the area ruled by the Sun (eye, vitality) o Since the 12th house also signifies the left side and hidden organs, the defect is partial (one eye) • Nadi astrology often links Sun + 12H + 6L with ocular issues or right-eye vision loss. Fully Explainable – Sun in 12H aspected by 6L/3L Jupiter = eye defect, typically one-sided (partial visual disability) 2. Father Leaves After Birth (ஜாதகன் பிறந்ததும் பிதா ஓடிப்போவார்): • 12th house = house of departure, isolation, exile • The Sun alone in the 12th, especially unprotected by benefics and aspected by the 6th lord, leads to: o Disconnection from the paternal figure o In Nadi texts, such a placement strongly indicates separation or physical absence of the father at or soon after the birth of the native. • Jupiter's role here (3rd & 6th lord): o 3rd = movement, change of place o 6th = conflict, division o Its aspect on the Sun activates karmic separation. • This could manifest as: o Father abandoning the family, being forced away, or a spiritual renunciation. Fully Explainable – 12H Sun + Jupiter (6L/3L) aspect = karmic separation from father at birth 3. Symbolic Layer (Nadi interpretation): • The Sun in 12H, with no conjunction and under Jupiter’s pressure, may also symbolize: o Paternal lineage bearing a karmic burden. o Loss of the father’s influence in shaping the native’s life • These symbolic meanings reinforce: o Both physical and emotional detachment from the father from birth Conclusion for Verse 58 • Father Has One-Eyed Vision Defect: Fully Explainable – Sun (right eye) in 12H, aspected by 6L/3L Jupiter → partial eye loss • Father Leaves at Birth: Fully Explainable – 12H Sun with no benefic protection + Jupiter’s aspect (conflict and departure) = early separation from father • Age Activation: Not applicable — results manifest at birth as per Nadi logic.",Libra,Surya
Libra-59,பனிரண்டாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் ஏகனாய் நின்று மூன்றிலிருக்கும் சுக பஞ்சமாதிபனால் நோக்கப் பட்டிருந்தால் தந்தைக்குத் தாரமிரண்டு. ஜாதகனுக்கு இருபத்தைந்திற்கு மேல் பிதா மரணமாவனென்பர்.,"For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka) is placed alone in the twelfth house and aspected by the lords of the fourth house (Sukha) and fifth house (Panchama)-Saturn positioned in the third house, then it is said that the father will have two marriages. Additionally, the father will pass away when the native reaches the age of twenty-five. Explanation: 1. Father Has Two Marriages (தந்தைக்கு தாரமிரண்டு): • Sun in the 12th house, which is the house of separation and endings, indicates: o Challenges in sustaining a single marital bond. o When alone, the Sun’s vitality and dharmic strength are diminished. • Saturn in the 3rd house: o Is the lord of 4th and 5th houses, and when it aspects the 12th house, it brings: • Emotional detachment • Repetition or delay in marriage (Saturn often indicates remarriage or a later second commitment) • In this context: o The first marriage is likely to be unsuccessful or end early. o The second occurs due to karmic necessity, often during a Saturn return or Dasa period. Fully Explainable – Saturn’s aspect on solitary Sun in 12H = marriage disruption + karmic indication of second marriage 2. Father Dies at Age 25 (இருபத்தைந்து): • Age 25 lies at the end of the 4th house Band of Years (19–24) and on the cusp of the 5th house Band (25–30) • The Sun in 12H (house of exit) being aspected by Saturn (natural significator of karma and death) aligns well with: o A karmically timed passing of the father • Saturn is also the 5th lord (putra and poorva punya), so its aspect activates: o Prarabdha karma in the paternal line o Completion of the father’s karmic journey around this transition point • The 12H Sun also signifies: o Retreat, exit, spiritual disengagement, especially when unprotected and influenced by cold Saturnine energy. Fully Explainable – Sun in 12H aspected by Saturn = karmic death of father at 25 (5H Band trigger) Age Activation Point (Band of Years): • Age 25 is the start of the 5th house Band of Years (25–30) • The 3rd house Saturn (aspecting Sun) activates the karma of: o Effort (3H) + legacy/children (5H) → strong karmic correlation Likely Dasa: • Saturn or Sun Dasa • Especially during Antardasa shifts involving 5H, 12H, or Maraka houses. Conclusion for Verse 59 • Father Has Two Marriages: Fully Explainable – Saturn's aspect on 12H Sun brings karmic disruption and signals remarriage. • Father Dies at Age 25: Fully Explainable – Sun in 12H, Saturn aspect, 5H Band start point = karmic exit of father • Age Activation Point: Age 25; Band of Years shifts from 4H to 5H; Saturn/Sun Dasa likely triggers.",Libra,Surya
Libra-60,"பனிரண்டாமிடத்தில் பிதுர்க்காரகன் ஏகனாயிருந்து பிதுர் ஸ்தானத்தில் ராகுயிருந்தால், தந்தையுடன் ஆணிரண்டு, தரித்திர முள்ளவர்கள். ஜாதகன் சமயோகத்தை யடைவனென்பர். For a native with Libra Lagna, if the significator of ancestors (Pitru Karaka) is placed alone in the twelfth house and if Rahu is positioned in the ancestral house (Pitru Sthana), then the father’s lineage will consist of two males. It is said that they will experience poverty, while the native will attain spiritual alignment (Samayoga). Explanation : 1. Father’s Lineage Includes Two males (தந்தையுடன் ஆண் இரண்டு): • Sun alone in 12th house: o The 12th house is a house of loss, isolation, spiritual withdrawal, and in this context, reflects a limited and karmically bound lineage. • Rahu in the 9th house: o Rahu, when placed in the house of the father and dharma, brings confusion, disruption, or distortion in family traditions. o It often curtails growth, resulting in a smaller lineage. • The combination of: o Sun in 12H (weak Pitrukaraka) o Rahu in 9H (affliction to paternal legacy) — Limits the continuation of the father's line, hence the two males' conclusion. Partially Explainable – Restriction logic is clear; “two” from traditional Nadi pada allocation. 2. They Are Poor (தரித்திரம் முள்ளவர்கள்): • Rahu in 9th house: o Disrupts Bhagya, ancestral blessings, and material fortune from the father’s side. o Causes poverty, disconnection from dharma, and often scattered karmic merit. • The Sun in the 12th house, unaccompanied by benefics, also denies: o Financial support, inheritance, or ancestral wealth • Together, this configuration signifies: o A lineage suffering karmic debts, unable to stabilize wealth. o Loss of dharmic fortune, both spiritual and material Fully Explainable – Rahu in 9H and Sun in 12H = breakdown of wealth flow and ancestral prosperity 3. The Native Attains Spiritual Alignment (ஜாதகன் சமயோகத்தை அடைவான்): • Samayoga here means: o Spiritual awakening, karmic detachment, or union with divine purpose • Sun alone in 12th house: o Highly indicative of moksha-karma o The native is often drawn toward renunciation, solitude, or higher knowledge. • Rahu in 9H, while disruptive materially, can promote occultism, philosophical inquiry, or non-traditional spiritual paths. o Especially if Jupiter aspects Rahu or influences 12H (not mentioned, but implied by outcome) Fully Explainable – 12H Sun + 9H Rahu = karmic detachment and spiritual growth for the native Symbolic Layer (Final Verse Insight): • This verse concludes Libra Lagna’s karmic arc with: o A spiritually oriented native o A lineage that is materially broken, yet spiritually redirecting • The Sun’s journey from Lagna to 12H ends in loss but enlightenment, mirroring the Nadi structure: → From ancestral formation (early verses) to spiritual dissolution (final verse) Conclusion for Verse 60 • Father’s Lineage Includes Two males: Partially Explainable – Clear karmic restriction; exact count from Nadi count tradition. • They Are Poor: Fully Explainable – Rahu affliction to 9H and Sun in 12H causes lineage-wide poverty. • Native Attains Samayoga (Spiritual Alignment): Fully Explainable – Sun in 12H alone + Rahu in 9H = ideal for karmic detachment and spiritual evolution • Age Activation: Not applicable – results unfold as life path outcomes, not timed events.
